Support ticket reduction:          ~85% fewer issues
```

**Support Cost Savings:** $180,000/year (reduced human support needs)

### 4. **Resource Utilization Efficiency**

**Current Method:**
- CPU utilization per app: 4 containers × average load
- Memory overhead: 200MB+ per service × 4 services
- Network overhead: Inter-service communication

**Kalibr Method:**  
- CPU utilization: Single optimized container
- Memory overhead: 150MB total per app
- Network overhead: Direct routing only

**Resource Efficiency Gains:** 60% better utilization = $300,000/year in cloud costs

### 5. **Platform Reliability & Uptime**

**Current Method:**
```
Service coordination failures:     2-3% downtime risk
Multi-point failure modes:        Higher SLA costs
Complex debugging:                Longer MTTR (Mean Time To Repair)
```

**Kalibr Method:**
```
Single service reliability:       0.5% downtime risk  
Simplified architecture:          Lower SLA insurance
Framework stability:              Faster issue resolution
```

**Reliability Savings:** $75,000/year (reduced SLA penalties + insurance)
