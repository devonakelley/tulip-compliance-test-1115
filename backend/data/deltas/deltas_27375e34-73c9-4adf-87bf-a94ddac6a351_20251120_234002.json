According to the definitions, a hazard cannot\nresult in harm until such time as a sequence of events or other circumstances (including normal use)\nlead to a hazardous situation. At this point, the risk can be assessed by estimating both severity and\nprobability of occurrence of harm that could result (see Figure\u00a0C.1). The probability of occurrence of\nharm can be expressed as a combination of separate probabilities (P1, P2) or as a single probability (P).\nA decomposition into P1 and P2 is not mandatory.\nNOTE\u00a01   Depending on the complexity of the medical device, a hazard can lead to multiple hazardous\nsituations, and each hazardous situation can lead to multiple harms.\nNOTE\u00a02   The probability of occurrence of harm (P) can be composed of separate P1 and P2 values.\nNOTE\u00a03   The thin arrows represent elements of risk analysis and the thick arrows depict how a hazard\ncan lead to harm\nFigure\u00a0C.1\u00a0\u2014 Pictorial example of the relationship between hazard, sequence of events,\nhazardous situation and harm (from ISO/IEC\u00a0Guide 63:2019[2])\n\ufeff\n30\b\n\u00a9 ISO 2019 \u2013 All rights reserved\nLicensed to Tulip Medical / Marc Pilkington (marc@tulipmedical.com)\nISO Store Order: OP-417460 / Downloaded: 2020-01-14\nSingle user licence only, copying and networking prohibited.\n\ufeff\nISO 14971:2019(E)\nA good starting point for this compilation is a review of experience with the same and similar\ntypes of medical devices. The review should take into account a manufacturer\u2019s own experience and,\nwhere appropriate, the experience of other manufacturers as reported in adverse event databases,\npublications, scientific literature and other available sources. This type of review is particularly useful\nfor the identification and listing of typical hazards and hazardous situations for a medical device and the\nassociated harm that can occur. Next, this listing and aids such as the list of examples in Table\u00a0C.1 can be\nused to compile an initial list of hazards.\nIt is then possible to begin identification of some of the sequences of events that together with hazards\ncould result in hazardous situations and harm. Since many hazards might never result in harm and can\nbe eliminated from further consideration, it could be useful to perform this analysis by starting with\nthe harm that the medical device might cause and work backwards to the hazardous situations, hazards\nand initiating causes. However, although this approach is useful for the reason described, it should be\nrecognised that it is not a thorough analysis. Many sequences of events will only be identified by the\nsystematic use of risk analysis techniques (such as those described in ISO/TR\u00a024971[9]). Analysis and\nidentification are further complicated by the many events and circumstances that have to be taken into\nconsideration such as those listed in Table\u00a0C.2. Thus, more than one risk analysis technique, and especially\ncomplementary techniques, are often used to complete a comprehensive analysis. Table\u00a0C.3 provides\nexamples of the relationship between hazards, sequences of events, hazardous situations, and harm.\nAlthough compilation of the lists of hazards, hazardous situations and sequences of events should\nbe completed as early as possible in the design and development process to facilitate risk control, in\npractice identification and compilation is an ongoing activity that continues throughout the life cycle of\nthe medical device through post-production to disposal.\nThis annex provides a non-exhaustive list of possible hazards that can be associated with different\nmedical devices (Table\u00a0 C.1) and a list of events and circumstances (Table\u00a0 C.2) that can result in\nhazardous situations, which can result in harm. Table\u00a0C.3 provides examples in a logical progression of\nhow a hazard can be transformed into a hazardous situation and produce harm by a sequence of events\nor circumstances.\nRecognising how hazards progress to hazardous situations is critical for estimating the probability\nof occurrence and severity of harm that could result. An objective of the process is to compile a\ncomprehensive set of hazardous situations. The identification of hazards and sequences of events are\nstepping stones to achieve this. The lists in the tables in this annex can be used to aid in the identification\nof hazardous situations. What is called a hazard needs to be determined by the manufacturer to suit the\nparticular analysis.\nC.2\t Examples of hazards\nThe list in Table\u00a0C.1 can be used to assist in the identification of hazards associated with a particular\nmedical device, which could ultimately result in harm.\n\ufeff\n\u00a9 ISO 2019 \u2013 All rights reserved\b\n31\nLicensed to Tulip Medical / Marc Pilkington (marc@tulipmedical.com)\nISO Store Order: OP-417460 / Downloaded: 2020-01-14\nSingle user licence only, copying and networking prohibited.\n\ufeff\nISO 14971:2019(E)\nTable\u00a0C.1\u00a0\u2014 Examples of hazards\nEnergy hazards\nBiological and chemical hazards\nPerformance-related hazards\nAcoustic energy\n\u2014   infrasound\n\u2014   sound pressure\n\u2014   ultrasonic\nElectric energy\nElectric fields\nLeakage current\n\u2014   earth leakage\n\u2014   enclosure leakage\nMagnetic fields\nStatic discharge\nVoltage\nMechanical energy\nKinetic energy\n\u2014   falling objects\n\u2014   high pressure fluid injection\n\u2014   moving parts\n\u2014   vibrating parts\nPotential (stored) energy\n\u2014   bending\n\u2014   compression\n\u2014   cutting, shearing\n\u2014   gravitational pull\n\u2014   suspended mass\n\u2014   tension\n\u2014   torsion\nRadiation energy\nIonizing radiation\n\u2014   accelerated particles\n(alpha particles, electrons,\nprotons, neutrons)\n\u2014   gamma\n\u2014   x-ray\nNon-ionizing radiation\n\u2014   infrared\n\u2014   laser\n\u2014   microwave\n\u2014   ultraviolet\nThermal energy\nCryogenic effects\nHyperthermic effects\nBiological agents\nBacteria\nFungi\nParasites\nPrions\nToxins\nViruses\nChemical agents\nCarcinogenic, mutagenic, reproduc\u00ad\ntive\nCaustic, corrosive\n\u2014   acidic\n\u2014   alkaline\n\u2014   oxidants\nFlammable, combustible, explosive\nFumes, vapors\nOsmotic\nParticles (including micro- and nano\u00ad\nparticles)\nPyrogenic\nSolvents\nToxic\n\u2014   asbestos\n\u2014   heavy metals\n\u2014   inorganic toxicants\n\u2014   organic toxicants\n\u2014   silica\nImmunological agents\nAllergenic\n\u2014   antiseptic substances\n\u2014   latex\nImmunosuppressive\nIrritants\n\u2014   cleaning residues\nSensitizing\nData\n\u2014   access\n\u2014   availability\n\u2014   confidentiality\n\u2014   transfer\n\u2014   integrity\nDelivery\n\u2014   quantity\n\u2014   rate\nDiagnostic information\n\u2014   examination result\n\u2014   image artefacts\n\u2014   image orientation\n\u2014   image resolution\n\u2014   patient identity / information\nFunctionality\n\u2014   alarm\n\u2014   critical performance\n\u2014   measurement\n\ufeff\n32\b\n\u00a9 ISO 2019 \u2013 All rights reserved\nLicensed to Tulip Medical / Marc Pilkington (marc@tulipmedical.com)\nISO Store Order: OP-417460 / Downloaded: 2020-01-14\nSingle user licence only, copying and networking prohibited.\n\ufeff\nISO 14971:2019(E)\nC.3\t Examples of events and circumstances\nIn order to identify foreseeable sequences of events, it is often useful to consider events and\ncircumstances that can cause them. Table\u00a0C.2 provides examples of events and circumstances, organized\ninto general categories. Although the list is certainly not exhaustive, it is intended to demonstrate the\nmany different types of events and circumstances that need to be taken into account to identify the\nforeseeable sequences of events for a medical device.\nTable\u00a0C.2\u00a0\u2014 Examples of events and circumstances\nGeneral category\nEvents and circumstances\nRequirements\nInadequate specification of:\n\u2014\t design parameters\n\u2014\t operating parameters\n\u2014\t performance requirements\n\u2014\t in-service requirements (e.g. maintenance, reprocessing)\n\u2014\t end of life\nManufacturing processes\nInsufficient control of:\n\u2014\t manufacturing processes\n\u2014\t changes to manufacturing processes\n\u2014\t materials\n\u2014\t materials compatibility information\n\u2014\t subcontractors\nTransport and storage\nInadequate packaging\nContamination or deterioration\nInappropriate environmental conditions\nEnvironmental factors\nPhysical factors (e.g. heat, pressure, time)\nChemical factors (e.g. corrosion, degradation, contamination)\nElectromagnetic fields (e.g. susceptibility to electromagnetic disturbance)\nInadequate supply of power\nInadequate supply of coolant\nCleaning, disinfection and\nsterilization\nLack of validated procedures\nInadequate specification of requirements\nInadequate performance of cleaning, disinfection or sterilization\nDisposal and scrapping\nNo or inadequate information provided\nUse error\nFormulation\nBiodegradation\nBiocompatibility\nNo information or inadequate specification provided\nIncorrect formulations\nUse error\n\ufeff\n\u00a9 ISO 2019 \u2013 All rights reserved\b\n33\nLicensed to Tulip Medical / Marc Pilkington (marc@tulipmedical.com)\nISO Store Order: OP-417460 / Downloaded: 2020-01-14\nSingle user licence only, copying and networking prohibited.\n\ufeff\nISO 14971:2019(E)\nGeneral category\nEvents and circumstances\nUsability\nConfusing or missing instructions for use\nComplex or confusing control system\nAmbiguous or unclear state of the medical device\nAmbiguous or unclear presentation of settings, measurements or other information\nMisrepresentation of results\nInsufficient visibility, audibility or tactility\nPoor mapping of controls to actions, or of displayed information to actual state\nControversial modes or mapping as compared to existing equipment\nUse by unskilled or untrained personnel\nInsufficient warning of side effects\nInadequate warning of hazards associated with re-use of single-use medical devices\nIncorrect measurement and other metrological aspects\nIncompatibility with consumables, accessories, other medical devices\nIncorrect patient identification\nSlips, lapses and mistakes\nFunctionality\nLoss of electrical or mechanical integrity\nDeterioration in performance (e.g. gradual occlusion of fluid or gas path, change\nin resistance to flow, electrical conductivity) as result of ageing, wear and re\u00ad\npeated use\nFailure of a component due to ageing, wear or fatigue\nSecurity\nUnsecured data ports that are externally accessible (e.g. network, serial or\nUSB ports)\nData without encryption\nSoftware vulnerabilities that can be exploited\nSoftware updates without authenticity confirmation\nC.4\t Examples of relationships between hazards, foreseeable sequences of events,\nhazardous situations and the harm that can occur\nTable\u00a0 C.3 illustrates the relationship between hazards, foreseeable sequences of events, hazardous\nsituations and harm for some simplified examples. Remember that one hazard can result in more than\none harm and that more than one sequence of events can give rise to a hazardous situation.\nThe decision on what constitutes a hazardous situation needs to be made to suit the particular analysis\nbeing carried out. In some circumstances it can be useful to describe a cover being left off a high voltage\nterminal as a hazardous situation, in other circumstances the hazardous situation can be more usefully\ndescribed as when a person is in contact with the high voltage terminal.\n\ufeff\nTable C.2 (continued)\n34\b\n\u00a9 ISO 2019 \u2013 All rights reserved\nLicensed to Tulip Medical / Marc Pilkington (marc@tulipmedical.com)\nISO Store Order: OP-417460 / Downloaded: 2020-01-14\nSingle user licence only, copying and networking prohibited.\n\ufeff\nISO 14971:2019(E)\nTable\u00a0C.3\u00a0\u2014 Relationship between hazards, foreseeable sequences of events,\nhazardous situations and the harm that can occur\nHazard\nForeseeable sequence of events\nHazardous situation\nHarm\nElectromagnetic\nenergy\n(high voltage)\n(1)\t Electrode cable unintentionally\nplugged into power line receptacle\nLine voltage appears on\nelectrodes\nSerious burns\nHeart fibrillation\nChemical (vol\u00ad\natile solvent,\nembolus)\n(1)\t Incomplete removal of volatile\nsolvent used in manufacturing\n(2)\t Solvent residue converts to gas at\nbody temperature\nDevelopment of gas embo\u00ad\nlism (bubbles in the blood\nstream) during dialysis\nInfarct\nBrain damage\nBiological (mi\u00ad\ncrobial contam\u00ad\nination)\n(1)\t Inadequate instructions provided\nfor decontaminating re-used\nanaesthesia tubing\n(2)\t Contaminated tubing used during\nanaesthesia\nBacteria released into\nairway of patient during\nanaesthesia\nBacterial infection\nFunctionality\n(no delivery)\n(1)\t Electrostatically charged patient\ntouches infusion pump\n(2)\t Electrostatic discharge (ESD) causes\npump and pump alarms to fail\nFailure to deliver insulin\nto patient with elevated\nblood glucose level, no\nwarning given\nMinor organ damage\nDecreased conscious\u00ad\nness\nFunctionality\n(no output)\n(1)\t Implantable defibrillator battery\nreaches the end of its useful life\n(2)\t Inappropriately long interval\nbetween clinical follow-up visits\nDefibrillator cannot\ndeliver shock when an\narrhythmia occurs\nDeath\nMeasurement\n(incorrect in\u00ad\nformation)\n(1)\t Measurement error\n(2)\t No detection by user\nIncorrect information\nreported to clinician, lead\u00ad\ning to misdiagnosis and/\nor lack of proper therapy\nProgression of disease\nSerious injury\n\ufeff\n\u00a9 ISO 2019 \u2013 All rights reserved\b\n35\nLicensed to Tulip Medical / Marc Pilkington (marc@tulipmedical.com)\nISO Store Order: OP-417460 / Downloaded: 2020-01-14\nSingle user licence only, copying and networking prohibited.\n\ufeff\nISO 14971:2019(E)\nBibliography\n[1]\nISO/IEC\u00a0Guide\u00a051:2014, Safety aspects\u00a0\u2014 Guidelines for their inclusion in standards\n[2]\nISO/IEC\u00a0Guide\u00a063:2019, Guide to the development and inclusion of aspects of safety in international\nstandards for medical devices\n[3]\nISO\u00a09000:2015, Quality management systems\u00a0\u2014 Fundamentals and vocabulary\n[4]\nISO\u00a010993-1, Biological evaluation of medical devices\u00a0\u2014 Part\u00a01: Evaluation and testing within a risk\nmanagement process\n[5]\nISO\u00a013485:2016, Medical devices\u00a0\u2014 Quality management systems\u00a0\u2014 Requirements for regulatory\npurposes\n[6]\nISO\u00a014155, Clinical investigation of medical devices for human subjects\u00a0\u2014 Good clinical practice\n[7]\nISO\u00a018113-1:2009, In vitro diagnostic medical devices\u00a0\u2014 Information supplied by the manufacturer\n(labelling)\u00a0\u2014 Part\u00a01: Terms, definitions and general requirements\n[8]\nISO\u00a0 20916, In vitro diagnostic medical devices \u2014 Clinical performance studies using specimens\nfrom human subjects \u2014 Good study practice\n[9]\nISO/TR\u00a024971, Medical devices\u00a0\u2014 Guidance on the application of ISO 14971\n[10]\nISO\u00a031000, Risk management\u00a0\u2014 Guidelines\n[11]\nIEC/TR\u00a060513, Fundamental aspects of safety standards for medical electrical equipment\n[12]\nIEC\u00a060601-1, Medical electrical equipment\u00a0\u2014 Part\u00a01: General requirements for basic safety and\nessential performance\n[13]\nIEC\u00a062366-1:2015, Medical devices\u00a0\u2014 Part\u00a01: Application of usability engineering to medical devices\n\ufeff\n36\b\n\u00a9 ISO 2019 \u2013 All rights reserved\nLicensed to Tulip Medical / Marc Pilkington (marc@tulipmedical.com)\nISO Store Order: OP-417460 / Downloaded: 2020-01-14\nSingle user licence only, copying and networking prohibited.\nLicensed to Tulip Medical / Marc Pilkington (marc@tulipmedical.com)\nISO Store Order: OP-417460 / Downloaded: 2020-01-14\nSingle user licence only, copying and networking prohibited.\n\ufeff\nISO 14971:2019(E)\n\ufeff\n\u00a9 ISO 2019 \u2013 All rights reserved\nICS\u200211.040.01\nPrice based on 36 pages\nLicensed to Tulip Medical / Marc Pilkington (marc@tulipmedical.com)\nISO Store Order: OP-417460 / Downloaded: 2020-01-14\nSingle user licence only, copying and networking prohibited.",

Many sequences of events will only be identified by the\nsystematic use of risk analysis techniques (such as those described in ISO/TR\u00a024971[9]). Analysis and\nidentification are further complicated by the many events and circumstances that have to be taken into\nconsideration such as those listed in Table\u00a0C.2. Thus, more than one risk analysis technique, and especially\ncomplementary techniques, are often used to complete a comprehensive analysis. Table\u00a0C.3 provides\nexamples of the relationship between hazards, sequences of events, hazardous situations, and harm.\nAlthough compilation of the lists of hazards, hazardous situations and sequences of events should\nbe completed as early as possible in the design and development process to facilitate risk control, in\npractice identification and compilation is an ongoing activity that continues throughout the life cycle of\nthe medical device through post-production to disposal.\nThis annex provides a non-exhaustive list of possible hazards that can be associated with different\nmedical devices (Table\u00a0 C.1) and a list of events and circumstances (Table\u00a0 C.2) that can result in\nhazardous situations, which can result in harm. Table\u00a0C.3 provides examples in a logical progression of\nhow a hazard can be transformed into a hazardous situation and produce harm by a sequence of events\nor circumstances.\nRecognising how hazards progress to hazardous situations is critical for estimating the probability\nof occurrence and severity of harm that could result. An objective of the process is to compile a\ncomprehensive set of hazardous situations. The identification of hazards and sequences of events are\nstepping stones to achieve this. The lists in the tables in this annex can be used to aid in the identification\nof hazardous situations. What is called a hazard needs to be determined by the manufacturer to suit the\nparticular analysis.\nC.2\t Examples of hazards\nThe list in Table\u00a0C.1 can be used to assist in the identification of hazards associated with a particular\nmedical device, which could ultimately result in harm.\n\ufeff\n\u00a9 ISO 2019 \u2013 All rights reserved\b\n31\nLicensed to Tulip Medical / Marc Pilkington (marc@tulipmedical.com)\nISO Store Order: OP-417460 / Downloaded: 2020-01-14\nSingle user licence only, copying and networking prohibited.\n\ufeff\nISO 14971:2019(E)\nTable\u00a0C.1\u00a0\u2014 Examples of hazards\nEnergy hazards\nBiological and chemical hazards\nPerformance-related hazards\nAcoustic energy\n\u2014   infrasound\n\u2014   sound pressure\n\u2014   ultrasonic\nElectric energy\nElectric fields\nLeakage current\n\u2014   earth leakage\n\u2014   enclosure leakage\nMagnetic fields\nStatic discharge\nVoltage\nMechanical energy\nKinetic energy\n\u2014   falling objects\n\u2014   high pressure fluid injection\n\u2014   moving parts\n\u2014   vibrating parts\nPotential (stored) energy\n\u2014   bending\n\u2014   compression\n\u2014   cutting, shearing\n\u2014   gravitational pull\n\u2014   suspended mass\n\u2014   tension\n\u2014   torsion\nRadiation energy\nIonizing radiation\n\u2014   accelerated particles\n(alpha particles, electrons,\nprotons, neutrons)\n\u2014   gamma\n\u2014   x-ray\nNon-ionizing radiation\n\u2014   infrared\n\u2014   laser\n\u2014   microwave\n\u2014   ultraviolet\nThermal energy\nCryogenic effects\nHyperthermic effects\nBiological agents\nBacteria\nFungi\nParasites\nPrions\nToxins\nViruses\nChemical agents\nCarcinogenic, mutagenic, reproduc\u00ad\ntive\nCaustic, corrosive\n\u2014   acidic\n\u2014   alkaline\n\u2014   oxidants\nFlammable, combustible, explosive\nFumes, vapors\nOsmotic\nParticles (including micro- and nano\u00ad\nparticles)\nPyrogenic\nSolvents\nToxic\n\u2014   asbestos\n\u2014   heavy metals\n\u2014   inorganic toxicants\n\u2014   organic toxicants\n\u2014   silica\nImmunological agents\nAllergenic\n\u2014   antiseptic substances\n\u2014   latex\nImmunosuppressive\nIrritants\n\u2014   cleaning residues\nSensitizing\nData\n\u2014   access\n\u2014   availability\n\u2014   confidentiality\n\u2014   transfer\n\u2014   integrity\nDelivery\n\u2014   quantity\n\u2014   rate\nDiagnostic information\n\u2014   examination result\n\u2014   image artefacts\n\u2014   image orientation\n\u2014   image resolution\n\u2014   patient identity / information\nFunctionality\n\u2014   alarm\n\u2014   critical performance\n\u2014   measurement\n\ufeff\n32\b\n\u00a9 ISO 2019 \u2013 All rights reserved\nLicensed to Tulip Medical / Marc Pilkington (marc@tulipmedical.com)\nISO Store Order: OP-417460 / Downloaded: 2020-01-14\nSingle user licence only, copying and networking prohibited.\n\ufeff\nISO 14971:2019(E)\nC.3\t Examples of events and circumstances\nIn order to identify foreseeable sequences of events, it is often useful to consider events and\ncircumstances that can cause them. Table\u00a0C.2 provides examples of events and circumstances, organized\ninto general categories. Although the list is certainly not exhaustive, it is intended to demonstrate the\nmany different types of events and circumstances that need to be taken into account to identify the\nforeseeable sequences of events for a medical device.\nTable\u00a0C.2\u00a0\u2014 Examples of events and circumstances\nGeneral category\nEvents and circumstances\nRequirements\nInadequate specification of:\n\u2014\t design parameters\n\u2014\t operating parameters\n\u2014\t performance requirements\n\u2014\t in-service requirements (e.g. maintenance, reprocessing)\n\u2014\t end of life\nManufacturing processes\nInsufficient control of:\n\u2014\t manufacturing processes\n\u2014\t changes to manufacturing processes\n\u2014\t materials\n\u2014\t materials compatibility information\n\u2014\t subcontractors\nTransport and storage\nInadequate packaging\nContamination or deterioration\nInappropriate environmental conditions\nEnvironmental factors\nPhysical factors (e.g. heat, pressure, time)\nChemical factors (e.g. corrosion, degradation, contamination)\nElectromagnetic fields (e.g. susceptibility to electromagnetic disturbance)\nInadequate supply of power\nInadequate supply of coolant\nCleaning, disinfection and\nsterilization\nLack of validated procedures\nInadequate specification of requirements\nInadequate performance of cleaning, disinfection or sterilization\nDisposal and scrapping\nNo or inadequate information provided\nUse error\nFormulation\nBiodegradation\nBiocompatibility\nNo information or inadequate specification provided\nIncorrect formulations\nUse error\n\ufeff\n\u00a9 ISO 2019 \u2013 All rights reserved\b\n33\nLicensed to Tulip Medical / Marc Pilkington (marc@tulipmedical.com)\nISO Store Order: OP-417460 / Downloaded: 2020-01-14\nSingle user licence only, copying and networking prohibited.\n\ufeff\nISO 14971:2019(E)\nGeneral category\nEvents and circumstances\nUsability\nConfusing or missing instructions for use\nComplex or confusing control system\nAmbiguous or unclear state of the medical device\nAmbiguous or unclear presentation of settings, measurements or other information\nMisrepresentation of results\nInsufficient visibility, audibility or tactility\nPoor mapping of controls to actions, or of displayed information to actual state\nControversial modes or mapping as compared to existing equipment\nUse by unskilled or untrained personnel\nInsufficient warning of side effects\nInadequate warning of hazards associated with re-use of single-use medical devices\nIncorrect measurement and other metrological aspects\nIncompatibility with consumables, accessories, other medical devices\nIncorrect patient identification\nSlips, lapses and mistakes\nFunctionality\nLoss of electrical or mechanical integrity\nDeterioration in performance (e.g. gradual occlusion of fluid or gas path, change\nin resistance to flow, electrical conductivity) as result of ageing, wear and re\u00ad\npeated use\nFailure of a component due to ageing, wear or fatigue\nSecurity\nUnsecured data ports that are externally accessible (e.g. network, serial or\nUSB ports)\nData without encryption\nSoftware vulnerabilities that can be exploited\nSoftware updates without authenticity confirmation\nC.4\t Examples of relationships between hazards, foreseeable sequences of events,\nhazardous situations and the harm that can occur\nTable\u00a0 C.3 illustrates the relationship between hazards, foreseeable sequences of events, hazardous\nsituations and harm for some simplified examples. Remember that one hazard can result in more than\none harm and that more than one sequence of events can give rise to a hazardous situation.\nThe decision on what constitutes a hazardous situation needs to be made to suit the particular analysis\nbeing carried out. In some circumstances it can be useful to describe a cover being left off a high voltage\nterminal as a hazardous situation, in other circumstances the hazardous situation can be more usefully\ndescribed as when a person is in contact with the high voltage terminal.\n\ufeff\nTable C.2 (continued)\n34\b\n\u00a9 ISO 2019 \u2013 All rights reserved\nLicensed to Tulip Medical / Marc Pilkington (marc@tulipmedical.com)\nISO Store Order: OP-417460 / Downloaded: 2020-01-14\nSingle user licence only, copying and networking prohibited.\n\ufeff\nISO 14971:2019(E)\nTable\u00a0C.3\u00a0\u2014 Relationship between hazards, foreseeable sequences of events,\nhazardous situations and the harm that can occur\nHazard\nForeseeable sequence of events\nHazardous situation\nHarm\nElectromagnetic\nenergy\n(high voltage)\n(1)\t Electrode cable unintentionally\nplugged into power line receptacle\nLine voltage appears on\nelectrodes\nSerious burns\nHeart fibrillation\nChemical (vol\u00ad\natile solvent,\nembolus)\n(1)\t Incomplete removal of volatile\nsolvent used in manufacturing\n(2)\t Solvent residue converts to gas at\nbody temperature\nDevelopment of gas embo\u00ad\nlism (bubbles in the blood\nstream) during dialysis\nInfarct\nBrain damage\nBiological (mi\u00ad\ncrobial contam\u00ad\nination)\n(1)\t Inadequate instructions provided\nfor decontaminating re-used\nanaesthesia tubing\n(2)\t Contaminated tubing used during\nanaesthesia\nBacteria released into\nairway of patient during\nanaesthesia\nBacterial infection\nFunctionality\n(no delivery)\n(1)\t Electrostatically charged patient\ntouches infusion pump\n(2)\t Electrostatic discharge (ESD) causes\npump and pump alarms to fail\nFailure to deliver insulin\nto patient with elevated\nblood glucose level, no\nwarning given\nMinor organ damage\nDecreased conscious\u00ad\nness\nFunctionality\n(no output)\n(1)\t Implantable defibrillator battery\nreaches the end of its useful life\n(2)\t Inappropriately long interval\nbetween clinical follow-up visits\nDefibrillator cannot\ndeliver shock when an\narrhythmia occurs\nDeath\nMeasurement\n(incorrect in\u00ad\nformation)\n(1)\t Measurement error\n(2)\t No detection by user\nIncorrect information\nreported to clinician, lead\u00ad\ning to misdiagnosis and/\nor lack of proper therapy\nProgression of disease\nSerious injury\n\ufeff\n\u00a9 ISO 2019 \u2013 All rights reserved\b\n35\nLicensed to Tulip Medical / Marc Pilkington (marc@tulipmedical.com)\nISO Store Order: OP-417460 / Downloaded: 2020-01-14\nSingle user licence only, copying and networking prohibited.\n\ufeff\nISO 14971:2019(E)\nBibliography\n[1]\nISO/IEC\u00a0Guide\u00a051:2014, Safety aspects\u00a0\u2014 Guidelines for their inclusion in standards\n[2]\nISO/IEC\u00a0Guide\u00a063:2019, Guide to the development and inclusion of aspects of safety in international\nstandards for medical devices\n[3]\nISO\u00a09000:2015, Quality management systems\u00a0\u2014 Fundamentals and vocabulary\n[4]\nISO\u00a010993-1, Biological evaluation of medical devices\u00a0\u2014 Part\u00a01: Evaluation and testing within a risk\nmanagement process\n[5]\nISO\u00a013485:2016, Medical devices\u00a0\u2014 Quality management systems\u00a0\u2014 Requirements for regulatory\npurposes\n[6]\nISO\u00a014155, Clinical investigation of medical devices for human subjects\u00a0\u2014 Good clinical practice\n[7]\nISO\u00a018113-1:2009, In vitro diagnostic medical devices\u00a0\u2014 Information supplied by the manufacturer\n(labelling)\u00a0\u2014 Part\u00a01: Terms, definitions and general requirements\n[8]\nISO\u00a0 20916, In vitro diagnostic medical devices \u2014 Clinical performance studies using specimens\nfrom human subjects \u2014 Good study practice\n[9]\nISO/TR\u00a024971, Medical devices\u00a0\u2014 Guidance on the application of ISO 14971\n[10]\nISO\u00a031000, Risk management\u00a0\u2014 Guidelines\n[11]\nIEC/TR\u00a060513, Fundamental aspects of safety standards for medical electrical equipment\n[12]\nIEC\u00a060601-1, Medical electrical equipment\u00a0\u2014 Part\u00a01: General requirements for basic safety and\nessential performance\n[13]\nIEC\u00a062366-1:2015, Medical devices\u00a0\u2014 Part\u00a01: Application of usability engineering to medical devices\n\ufeff\n36\b\n\u00a9 ISO 2019 \u2013 All rights reserved\nLicensed to Tulip Medical / Marc Pilkington (marc@tulipmedical.com)\nISO Store Order: OP-417460 / Downloaded: 2020-01-14\nSingle user licence only, copying and networking prohibited.\nLicensed to Tulip Medical / Marc Pilkington (marc@tulipmedical.com)\nISO Store Order: OP-417460 / Downloaded: 2020-01-14\nSingle user licence only, copying and networking prohibited.\n\ufeff\nISO 14971:2019(E)\n\ufeff\n\u00a9 ISO 2019 \u2013 All rights reserved\nICS\u200211.040.01\nPrice based on 36 pages\nLicensed to Tulip Medical / Marc Pilkington (marc@tulipmedical.com)\nISO Store Order: OP-417460 / Downloaded: 2020-01-14\nSingle user licence only, copying and networking prohibited."

Risk reduction \"as far as possible\" versus \"as low as reasonably practicable\":\n\na) Annex D.8 to ISO 14971, referred to in 3.4, contains the concept of reducing risks \"as low as\nreasonably practicable\" (ALARP concept). The ALARP concept contains an element of economic\nconsideration.\nb) However, the first indent of Section 2 of Annex I to Directive 93/42/EEC and various particular\nEssential Requirements require risks to be reduced \"as far as possible\" without there being room for\neconomic considerations.\nc) Accordingly, manufacturers and Notified Bodies may not apply the ALARP concept with regard to\neconomic considerations.\n\n4. Discretion as to whether a risk-benefit analysis needs to take place:\n\na) 6.5 of ISO 14971 says: \"If the residual risk is not judged acceptable using the criteria established in\nthe risk management plan and further risk control is not practicable, the manufacturer may gather and\nreview data and literature to determine if the medical benefits of the intended use outweigh the\nresidual risk.\" Clause 7 of ISO 14971 says: \"If the overall residual risk is not judged acceptable using\nthe criteria established in the risk management plan, the manufacturer may gather and review data\nand literature to determine if the medical benefits of the intended use outweigh the overall residual\nrisk.\" Both quotes imply that an overall risk-benefit analysis does not need to take place if the overall\nresidual risk is judged acceptable when using the criteria established in the risk management plan.\nEqually, D.6.1 says: \"A risk/benefit analysis is not required by this International Standard for every\nrisk.\"\nb) According to Section 1 of Annex I to Directive 93/42/EEC, an overall risk-benefit analysis must take\nplace in any case, regardless of the application of criteria established in the management plan of the\nmanufacturer. Furthermore, Section 6 of Annex I to Directive 93/42/EEC requires undesirable side-\neffects to \"constitute an acceptable risk when weighed against the performance intended\".\nc) Accordingly, the manufacturer must undertake the risk-benefit analysis for the individual risk and the\noverall risk-benefit analysis (weighing all risks combined against the benefit) in all cases.\n\n5. Discretion as to the risk control options/measures:\n\na) 6.2 of ISO 14971 obliges the manufacturer to \"use one or more of the following risk control options\nin the priority order listed: (a) inherent safety by design; (b) protective measures in the medical device\nitself or in the manufacturing process; (c) information for safety\" and leaves a discretion as to the\napplication of these three options: shall the second or third control option still be used when the first\nwas used? 6.4 indicates that further risk control measures do not need to be taken if, after applying\none of the control options, the risk is judged acceptable according to the criteria of the risk\nmanagement plan.\nb) However, the second sentence of Section 2 of Annex I to Directive 93/42/EEC requests \"to conform\nto safety principles, taking account of the generally acknowledged state of the art\" and \"to select the\nmost appropriate solutions\" by applying cumulatively what has been called \"control options\" or \"control\nmechanisms\" in the standard.\nc) Accordingly, the manufacturer must apply all the \"control options\" and may not stop his endeavours\nif the first or the second control option has reduced the risk to an \"acceptable level\" (unless the\nadditional control option(s) do(es) not improve the safety).\n\n6. Deviation as to the first risk control option:\n\na) 6.2 of ISO 14971 obliges the manufacturer to \"use one or more of the following risk control options\nin the priority order listed: (a) inherent safety by design \u2026\" without determining what is meant by this\nterm.\nb) However, the first indent of the second sentence of Section 2 of Annex I to Directive 93/42/EEC\nrequires to \"eliminate or reduce risks as far as possible (inherently safe design and construction)\".\nc) Accordingly, as the Directive is more precise than the standard, manufacturers must apply the\nformer and cannot rely purely on the application of the standard.\n\n7. Information of the users influencing the residual risk:\n\na) The residual risk is in 2.15 and in 6.4 of ISO 14971 defined as the risk remaining after application of\nthe risk control measures. 6.2 of ISO 14971 regards \"information for safety\" to be a control option.\nCOPYRIGHT Danish Standards.

The standard leads,\naccording to experience of the authorities, to a higher degree of compliance with legal obligations.\n\nEN ISO 14971:2012 provides a process for managing risks associated with medical devices. Because\nthis standard describes an ongoing, lifecycle process applicable in part or in all to the Essential\nRequirements of Directive 90/385/EEC on Active Implantable Medical Devices, it is \u2013 very\nexceptionally \u2013 not meaningful to link individual clauses of the standard to specific corresponding\nEssential Requirements.\n\nCompliance with all the normative clauses in EN ISO 14971 will ensure that a process is in place to\naddress general risk management aspects related to medical devices, which are included in the\nEssential Requirements. However, because this is an International Standard, intended to be\napplicable in jurisdictions all over the world, it is not the primary goal of the standard to cover exactly\nany of the European Essential Requirements. Therefore, for all of the Essential Requirements,\nconformity is not entirely achieved by complying only with the requirements specified in this standard.\nManufacturers and conformity assessment bodies will need to feed the Essential Requirements into\nthe risk management process provided by the standard. Explanation on the correspondence of the\nstandard and the Essential Requirements is included in Table ZB.1. Further explanation on content\ndeviations between the standard and the ERs is provided below the table.\n\nTable ZB.1 \u2014 Correspondence between this European Standard and Directive 90/385/EEC\nClause(s)/subclause(s) of\nthis EN\nEssential Requirements\n(ERs) of Directive 90/385/EEC\nQualifying\nremarks/Notes\n1-9\n1\nER 1 is not directly covered by EN\nISO 14971, since the standard does\nnot provide requirements on design\nand manufacture.

Treatment of negligible risks:\n\na) According to ISO 14971, the manufacturer may discard negligible risks4.\nb) However, Sections 1 and 6 of Annex I to Directive 90/385/EEC require that all risks, regardless of\ntheir dimension, need to be reduced as much as possible.\nc) Accordingly, the manufacturer must take all risks into account when assessing Sections 1 and 6 of\nAnnex I to Directive 90/385/EEC.\n\n2. Discretionary power of manufacturers as to the acceptability of risks:\n\na) ISO 14971 seems to imply that manufacturers have the freedom to decide upon the threshold for\nrisk acceptability5 and that only non-acceptable risks have to be integrated into the overall risk-benefit\nanalysis6.\nb) However, Sections 1 and 6 of Annex I to Directive 90/385/EEC require that all risks have to be\nreduced as far as possible.\nc) Accordingly, the manufacturer may not apply any criteria of risk acceptability prior to applying\nSections 1 and 6 of Annex I to Directive 90/385/EEC.\n\n3. Risk reduction \"as far as possible\" versus \"as low as reasonably practicable\":\n\na) D.8 of ISO 14971, referred to in 3.4, contains the concept of reducing risks \"as low as reasonably\npracticable\" (ALARP concept). The ALARP concept contains an element of economic consideration.\nb) However, various Essential Requirements require risks to be reduced \"as far as possible\" without\nthere being room for economic considerations.\nc) Accordingly, manufacturers and Notified Bodies may not apply the ALARP concept with regard to\neconomic considerations.\n\n4. Discretion as to whether a risk-benefit analysis needs to take place:\n\na) 6.5 of ISO 14971 says: \"If the residual risk is not judged acceptable using the criteria established in\nthe risk management plan and further risk control is not practicable, the manufacturer may gather and\nreview data and literature to determine if the medical benefits of the intended use outweigh the\nresidual risk.\" Clause 7 of ISO 14971 says: \"If the overall residual risk is not judged acceptable using\nthe criteria established in the risk management plan, the manufacturer may gather and review data\nand literature to determine if the medical benefits of the intended use outweigh the overall residual\nrisk.\" Both quotes imply that an overall risk-benefit analysis does not need to take place if the overall\nresidual risk is judged acceptable when using the criteria established in the risk management plan.\nEqually, D.6.1 says: \"A risk-benefit analysis is not required by this International Standard for every\nrisk.\"\nb) Section 5 of Annex I to Directive 90/385/EEC requires any side effects or undesirable conditions to\n\"constitute acceptable risks when weighed against the performances intended\", implying that an\noverall risk-benefit analysis must take place in any case, regardless of the application of criteria\nestablished in the management plan of the manufacturer.\nc) Accordingly, the manufacturer must undertake the risk-benefit analysis for the individual risk and the\noverall risk-benefit analysis (weighing all risks combined against the benefit) in all cases.\n\n\n\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003",

For hazardous situations for which the probability of the occurrence of harm cannot be estimated, the\npossible consequences shall be listed for use in risk evaluation and risk control. The results of these activities\nshall be recorded in the risk management file.\nAny system used for qualitative or quantitative categorization of probability of occurrence of harm or severity\nof harm shall be recorded in the risk management file.\nNOTE 4\nRisk estimation incorporates an analysis of the probability of occurrence and the consequences. Depending\non the application, only certain elements of the risk estimation process might need to be considered. For example, in some\ninstances it will not be necessary to go beyond an initial hazard and consequence analysis. See also D.3.\nNOTE 5\nRisk estimation can be quantitative or qualitative. Methods of risk estimation, including those resulting from\nsystematic faults, are described in Annex D. Annex H gives information useful for estimating risks for in vitro diagnostic\nmedical devices.\nNOTE 6\nInformation or data for estimating risks can be obtained, for example, from:\na)\npublished standards;\nb)\nscientific technical data;\nc)\nfield data from similar medical devices already in use, including published reported incidents;\nd)\nusability tests employing typical users;\ne)\nclinical evidence;\nf)\nresults of appropriate investigations;\ng)\nexpert opinion;\nh)\nexternal quality assessment schemes.\nCompliance is checked by inspection of the risk management file.\n5\nRisk evaluation\nFor each identified hazardous situation, the manufacturer shall decide, using the criteria defined in the risk\nmanagement plan, if risk reduction is required. If risk reduction is not required, the requirements given in 6.2 to\n6.6 do not apply for this hazardous situation (i.e., proceed to 6.7). The results of this risk evaluation shall be\nrecorded in the risk management file.\nNOTE 1\nGuidance for deciding on risk acceptability is given in D.4.\nNOTE 2\nApplication of relevant standards, as part of the medical device design criteria, might constitute risk control\nactivities, thus meeting the requirements given in 6.3 to 6.6.\nCompliance is checked by inspection of the risk management file.\nCOPYRIGHT Danish Standards.

The standard leads,\naccording to experience of the authorities, to a higher degree of compliance with legal obligations.\n\nEN ISO 14971:2012 provides a process for managing risks associated with medical devices. Because\nthis standard describes an ongoing, lifecycle process applicable in part or in all to the Essential\nRequirements of Directive 98/79/EC on In Vitro Diagnostic Medical Devices, it is \u2013 very exceptionally \u2013\nnot meaningful to link individual clauses of the standard to specific corresponding Essential\nRequirements.\n\nCompliance with all the normative clauses in EN ISO 14971 will ensure that a process is in place to\naddress general risk management aspects related to medical devices, which are included in the\nEssential Requirements. However, because this is an International Standard, intended to be\napplicable in jurisdictions all over the world, it is not the primary goal of the standard to cover exactly\nany of the European Essential Requirements. Therefore, for all of the Essential Requirements,\nconformity is not entirely achieved by complying only with the requirements specified in this standard.\nManufacturers and conformity assessment bodies will need to feed the Essential Requirements into\nthe risk management process provided by the standard. Explanation on the correspondence of the\nstandard and the Essential Requirements is included in Table ZC.1. Further explanation on content\ndeviations between the standard and the ERs is provided below the table.\n\nTable ZC.1 \u2014 Correspondence between this European Standard and Directive 98/79/EEC\nClause(s)/subclause(s) of\nthis EN\nEssential Requirements\n(ERs) of Directive 98/79/EC\nQualifying\nremarks/Notes\n1-9\nA.1\nER A.1 is not directly covered by EN\nISO 14971, since the standard does\nnot provide requirements on design\nand manufacture.

Treatment of negligible risks:\n\na) According to ISO 14971, the manufacturer may discard negligible risks7.\nb) However, Sections A.1 and A.2 of Annex I to Directive 98/79/EC require that all risks, regardless of\ntheir dimension, need to be reduced as much as possible and need to be balanced, together with all\nother risks, against the benefit of the device.\nc) Accordingly, the manufacturer must take all risks into account when assessing Sections A.1 and A.2\nof Annex I to Directive 98/79/EC.\n\n2. Discretionary power of manufacturers as to the acceptability of risks:\n\na) ISO 14971 seems to imply that manufacturers have the freedom to decide upon the threshold for\nrisk acceptability8 and that only non-acceptable risks have to be integrated into the overall risk-benefit\nanalysis9.\nb) However, Sections A.1 and A.2 of Annex I to Directive 98/79/EC require that all risks have to be\nreduced as far as possible and that all risks combined, regardless of any \"acceptability\" assessment,\nneed to be balanced, together with all other risks, against the benefit of the device.\nc) Accordingly, the manufacturer may not apply any criteria of risk acceptability prior to applying\nSections A.1 and A.2 of Annex I to Directive 98/79/EC.\n\n3. Risk reduction \"as far as possible\" versus \"as low as reasonably practicable\":\n\na) D.8 to ISO 14971, referred to in 3.4, contains the concept of reducing risks \"as low as reasonably\npracticable\" (ALARP concept). The ALARP concept contains an element of economic consideration.\nb) However, the first indent of Section A.2 of Annex I to Directive 98/79/EC and various particular\nEssential Requirements require risks to be reduced \"as far as possible\" without there being room for\neconomic considerations.\nc) Accordingly, manufacturers and Notified Bodies may not apply the ALARP concept with regard to\neconomic considerations.\n\n4. Discretion as to whether a risk-benefit analysis needs to take place:\n\na) 6.5 of ISO 14971 says: \"If the residual risk is not judged acceptable using the criteria established in\nthe risk management plan and further risk control is not practicable, the manufacturer may gather and\nreview data and literature to determine if the medical benefits of the intended use outweigh the\nresidual risk.\" Clause 7 of ISO 14971 says: \"If the overall residual risk is not judged acceptable using\nthe criteria established in the risk management plan, the manufacturer may gather and review data\nand literature to determine if the medical benefits of the intended use outweigh the overall residual\nrisk.\" Both quotes imply that an overall risk-benefit analysis does not need to take place if the overall\nresidual risk is judged acceptable when using the criteria established in the risk management plan.\nEqually, D.6.1 says: \"A risk-benefit analysis is not required by this International Standard for every\nrisk.\"\nb) According to Section A.1 of Annex I to Directive 98/79/EC, an overall risk-benefit analysis must take\nplace in any case, regardless of the application of criteria established in the management plan of the\nmanufacturer.\nc) Accordingly, the manufacturer must undertake the overall risk-benefit analysis (weighing all risks\ncombined against the benefit) in all cases.\n\n\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003",

During the development of this edition, this rationale was updated to\ntake account of normative changes. Those who make future revisions to this International Standard can use\nthis annex, along with experience gained in the use of this International Standard, to make this International\nStandard more useful to manufacturers, regulatory bodies and health care providers.\nA standard for the application of risk management to medical devices became important largely because of\nthe increasing recognition by regulators, that the manufacturer should apply risk management to medical\ndevices. No medical device risk management standard existed, and this International Standard has been\nwritten to fill that gap. ISO/TC 210 Working Group 4 was formed to develop the new International Standard.\nAlmost simultaneously, drafters of the third edition of IEC 60601-1[23] planned to have risk management\nincluded in the standard then under development. They saw the need for a separate risk management activity\nand formed Working Group 15 of IEC/SC 62A. Recognising that the efforts of these two working groups\noverlapped, IEC and ISO formed the Joint Working Group 1 (JWG 1) on risk management combining the\nmembership of both working groups. This collaboration resulted in the publication of ISO 14971 with both an\nISO and an IEC logo. ISO and IEC also recognise each other\u2019s single-logo standards as the international\nstandards covering their respective subjects. The dual logo signifies that the standard has been developed\njointly by both communities, through the ISO Member Bodies and the IEC National Committees.\nWhen discussions began on the international risk management standard, crucial features of risk management\nneeded to be addressed, such as the process of risk evaluation, as well as the balancing of risks and benefits\nfor medical devices. Manufacturers, regulatory bodies, and health care providers had recognised that\n\u201cabsolute safety\u201d in medical devices was not achievable. In addition, the risks that derive from the increasing\ndiversity of medical devices and their applications cannot be completely addressed through product safety\nstandards. The recognition of these facts and the consequent need to manage risks from medical devices\nthroughout their life-cycle led to the decision to develop ISO 14971.\nThe original plan was to write the standard in several parts, each dealing with a specific aspect of risk\nmanagement. ISO 14971-1, covering risk analysis, was intended as the first part of an overall risk\nmanagement standard. Later, it was decided that it was better to develop a single document that would\ninclude all aspects of risk management. The main reason for this was that it was apparent that risk\nmanagement would be mandated by several regulatory regimes in the world. It was therefore no longer useful\nor necessary to have a separate standard on risk analysis available. Also, making one risk management\nstandard instead of having several parts would much better show the coherence between the several aspects\nof risk management.\nThis edition of ISO 14971 was developed to address the need for additional guidance on its application. Minor\nchanges were made to the normative section, such as the addition of the requirement to plan for post-\nproduction monitoring and the removal of the requirement for traceability from the risk management report.\nNew guidance on the relationship between hazards and hazardous situations was developed and placed in\nAnnex E (formerly Annex D). Each use of these terms in this International Standard was reviewed to ensure\nconsistency with this guidance.\nThe following text gives further information on the clauses and subclauses in ISO 14971.\nCOPYRIGHT Danish Standards.

IVD medical devices are specifically mentioned in\nthe scope to avoid any misunderstanding that, due to different regulations, might be excluded from this\nInternational Standard.\nRisks can be introduced throughout the product life-cycle, and risks that become apparent at one point in the\nlife-cycle can be managed by action taken at a completely different point in the life-cycle. For this reason, the\nstandard needs to be a complete life-cycle standard. This means that the standard instructs manufacturers to\napply risk management principles to a medical device from its initial conception until its ultimate\ndecommissioning and disposal.\nThe scope of this International Standard does not include decisions on the use of a medical device. The\ndecision to use a medical device in the context of a particular clinical procedure requires the residual risks to\nbe balanced against the anticipated benefits of the procedure or the risks and anticipated benefits of\nalternative procedures. Such judgements should take into account the intended use, performance and risks\nassociated with the medical device as well as the risks and benefits associated with the clinical procedure or\nthe circumstances of use. Some of these judgements can be made only by a qualified health care professional\nwith knowledge of the state of health of an individual patient and the patient's own opinion.\nAlthough there has been significant debate over what constitutes an acceptable level of risk, this International\nStandard does not specify acceptability levels. Specifying a universal level for acceptable risk could be\ninappropriate. This decision is based upon the belief that:\n\u007f the wide variety of medical devices and situations covered by this International Standard would make a\nuniversal level meaningless;\n\u007f local laws, customs, values and perception of risk are more appropriate for defining risk acceptability for a\nparticular culture or region of the world.\nBecause not all countries require a quality management system for medical device manufacturers, a quality\nmanagement system is not a requirement of this International Standard. However, a quality management\nsystem is extremely helpful in managing risks properly. Because of this and because most medical device\nmanufacturers do employ a quality management system, this International Standard is constructed so that it\ncan easily be incorporated into the quality management system that they use.\nA.2.2 Terms and definitions\nTo avoid inventing a host of new and possibly unfamiliar terms, this International Standard is intentionally built\nupon the wealth of risk management information both in standards and in the literature. Existing definitions\nhave been used wherever possible. The primary sources for the definitions are:\n\u007f ISO/IEC Guide 51:1999, Safety aspects \u2014 Guidelines for the inclusion in standards\n\u007f ISO 9000:2005, Quality management systems \u2014 Fundamentals and vocabulary\n\u007f ISO 13485:2003, Medical devices \u2014 Quality management systems \u2014 Requirements for regulatory\npurposes\nSome of these definitions have a slightly different meaning in this International Standard. For example, JWG 1\nintended the definition of \u201charm\u201d (2.2) to include unreasonable psychological stress or unwanted pregnancy as\npart of \u201cdamage to the health of people.\u201d It was known that risk management would be made mandatory,\neither explicitly or implicitly, in many countries and regions of the world. An attempt was therefore made to use\ndefinitions that would be widely acceptable in a regulatory sense. For example, the term, \u201cmanufacturer\u201d (2.8),\nwhile based on the medical device directive in the EU, is consistent with the definition used in the United\nStates. The term, \u201cmedical device\u201d (2.9), was taken from ISO 13485[8], which adopted the definition developed\nby the Global Harmonization Task Force (GHTF). See bibliographic reference [38].\nCOPYRIGHT Danish Standards. NOT FOR COMMERCIAL USE OR REPRODUCTION. DS/EN ISO 14971:2012\nCopyright Dansk Standard\nProvided by IHS under license with DS-DANSK\nSold to:TULIP MEDICAL, W1446326\nNot for Resale,2013/3/26 19:10:12 GMT\nNo reproduction or networking permitted without license from IHS\n--`,``,,,,`,,,``,``,``,-`-`,,`,,`,`,,`---\nISO 14971:2007(E)\n\u00a9 ISO 2007 \u2013 All rights reserved\n17\nThe definition of the term, \u201cintended use\u201d (2.5) combines the definition of \u201cintended use\u201d as used in the United\nStates and \u201cintended purpose,\u201d which is the term in the European Union. These terms have essentially the\nsame definition. It was intended that, when considering the intended use of a medical device, the\nmanufacturer take account of the intended users of the product.\nSeven other terms in ISO 14971 are not based on definitions in other standards. These are \u201clife-cycle\u201d (2.7),\n\u201cpost-production\u201d (2.11), \u201crisk control\u201d (2.19), \u201crisk evaluation\u201d (2.21), \u201crisk estimation\u201d (2.20), \u201crisk\nmanagement\u201d (2.22), and \u201crisk management file\u201d (2.23). The definition of \u201clife-cycle\u201d was necessary to make it\nclear that the term as used in this International Standard covers all aspects of the existence of a medical\ndevice. A definition of \"post-production\" was added to emphasise that the entire life-cycle of the medical\ndevice is important for risk management. The definition for \u201crisk control\u201d was provided to be consistent with the\ndefinitions of \u201crisk analysis\u201d given by ISO/IEC Guide 51[2]. In the first edition, the definition of risk evaluation\nused the term \u201ccurrent values of society\u201d. In this edition, this reference has been removed for two reasons:\none is that the definition of the term should not contain a requirement, and the other is that \u201ccurrent values of\nsociety\u201d is an imprecise term. The removal of the term from the definition is compensated for by the fact that\nthe concept is already in the introduction and by providing additional normative requirements for the risk\nmanagement policy and by guidance on risk acceptability. The definition for \u201crisk management\u201d emphasises\nthe use of a systematic approach and the need for management oversight. The concept of a \u201crisk\nmanagement file\u201d was originally expressed in IEC 60601-1-4[24], but the definition was changed because the\ndefinition in IEC 60601-1-4 refers to quality records, which need not exist for compliance with ISO 14971.\nThe definition of \u201ctop management\u201d (2.26) uses the definition from ISO 9000:2005[4]. It applies to the person\nor group at the highest level in an organization.\nA.2.3 General requirements for risk management\nA.2.3.1\nRisk management process\nSubclause 3.1 requires the manufacturer to establish a risk management process as part of the design of a\nmedical device. This is required so that the manufacturer can systematically ensure that the required elements\nare in the process. Risk analysis, risk evaluation and risk control are commonly recognised as essential parts\nof risk management. In addition to these elements, this International Standard emphasises that the risk\nmanagement process does not end with the design and production (including, as relevant, sterilization,\npackaging, and labelling) of a medical device, but continues on into the post-production phase. Therefore, the\ngathering of post-production information was identified as a required part of the risk management process.\nFurthermore, it was felt that when a manufacturer employs a quality management system, the risk\nmanagement process should be fully integrated into that quality management system.\nAlthough risk management activities are highly individual to the medical device being evaluated, there are\nbasic elements that need to be included in the risk management process. This clause addresses that need.\nThis clause also recognises that there can be some differences in regulatory approach to applying risk\nmanagement to medical devices.\nSubclauses 3.2 and 3.3 closely follow some requirements of quality management system standards. In some\ncountries a quality management system is always required to market a device (unless the device is\nspecifically exempted). In other countries manufacturers can choose whether to apply a quality management\nsystem. However, the requirements of subclauses 3.2 and 3.3 are always needed for an effective risk\nmanagement process, whether or not the manufacturer operates all the other elements of a quality\nmanagement system.\nA.2.3.2\nManagement responsibilities\nThe commitment of top management is critical for an effective risk management process. These individuals\nshould take responsibility for overall guidance of the risk management process and this subclause is intended\nto emphasise their role. In particular:\na)\nin the absence of adequate resources, risk management activities would be less effective, even if\ncomplying, to the letter, with the other requirements of this International Standard;\nCOPYRIGHT Danish Standards.

The risk\nmanagement process requires people with expertise in areas such as:\n\u007f how the medical device is constructed;\n\u007f how the medical device works;\n\u007f how the medical device is produced;\n\u007f how the medical device is actually used;\n\u007f how to apply the risk management process.\nIn general, this will require several representatives from various functions or disciplines, each contributing their\nspecialist knowledge. The balance and relation between individuals performing risk management tasks should\nbe considered.\nRecords of the appropriate qualifications are required to provide objective evidence. In order to avoid\nduplication and because of confidentiality and data protection considerations, this International Standard does\nnot require these records to be kept in the risk management file.\nA.2.3.4\nRisk management plan\nA risk management plan is required because:\na)\nan organized approach is essential for good risk management;\nb)\nthe plan provides the roadmap for risk management;\nc)\nthe plan encourages objectivity and helps prevent essential elements being forgotten.\nThe elements a) to f) (subclause 3.4) are required for the following reasons.\n\u007f There are two distinct elements in the scope of the plan. The first identifies the intended medical device,\nthe other identifies the phase of the life-cycle covered by each element in the plan. By defining the scope,\nthe manufacturer establishes the baseline on which all the risk management activities are built.\n\u007f Allocation of responsibilities and authorities are needed to ensure that no responsibility is omitted.\n\u007f Review of activities such as risk management is included as a generally recognised responsibility of\nmanagement.\n\u007f The criteria for risk acceptability are fundamental to risk management and should be decided upon before\nrisk analysis begins. This helps make the process in Clause 5 to be objective.\nCOPYRIGHT Danish Standards. NOT FOR COMMERCIAL USE OR REPRODUCTION.

Planning this activity helps ensure that essential\nresources are available when required. If verification is not planned, important parts of the verification\ncould be neglected.\n\u007f Device specific methods for obtaining production and post-production information need to be established\nso that there is a formal and appropriate way to feed back production and post-production information into\nthe risk management process.\nThe requirement to keep a record of changes is to facilitate audit and review of the risk management process\nfor a particular medical device.\nA.2.3.5\nRisk management file\nThis International Standard uses this term to signify where the manufacturer can locate or find the locations of\nall the records and other documents applicable to risk management. This facilitates the risk management\nprocess and enables more efficient auditing to this International Standard. Traceability is necessary to\ndemonstrate that the risk management process has been applied to each identified hazard.\nCompleteness is very important in risk management. An incomplete task can mean that an identified hazard is\nnot controlled and harm to someone can be the consequence. The problem can result from incompleteness at\nany stage of risk management, e.g. unidentified hazards, risks not assessed, unspecified risk control\nmeasures, risk control measures not implemented or risk control measures that prove ineffective. Traceability\nis needed to establish completeness of the risk management process.\nA.2.4 Risk analysis\nA.2.4.1\nRisk analysis process\nThe second paragraph describes how to deal with the availability of a risk analysis for a similar medical device.\nThe note informs users of this International Standard that when adequate information already exists it can and\nshould be applied to save time, effort and other resources. Users of this International Standard need to be\ncareful, however, to assess systematically the previous work for applicability to the current risk analysis.\nNote that details required by a), b), and c) form the basic minimum data set for ensuring traceability and are\nimportant for management reviews and for subsequent audits. The requirement in c) also helps clarify what is\nin the scope of the analysis and verifies completeness.\nA.2.4.2\nIntended use and identification of characteristics related to the safety of the medical device\nThis step forces the manufacturer to think about all the characteristics that could affect safety of the medical\ndevice. The manufacturer should also consider the intended user(s) of the medical device, e.g., whether a lay\nuser or a trained medical professional will use the medical device. This analysis should consider that medical\ndevices can also be used in situations other than those intended by the manufacturer and in situations other\nthan those foreseen when a medical device is first conceived. Medical devices are frequently used in\nsituations other than those intended by the manufacturer and in situations other than those foreseen when a\nmedical device is first conceived. It is important that the manufacturer tries to look into the future to see the\nhazards due to potential uses of their medical device.\nAnnex C is intended to be helpful in describing the characteristics of the medical device and the environments\nin which it is used. It cannot be emphasised too strongly that this list is not exhaustive. Every manufacturer\nshould be creative in determining the relevant safety characteristics for the medical device under investigation.\nThe list in Annex C was originally taken from ISO 14971-1 with some additions made as a result of comments\non drafts of that standard. The list ought to stimulate thinking of \u201cwhere can things go wrong.\u201d Annex H on in\nvitro diagnostic medical devices has been developed by ISO/TC 212, Clinical laboratory testing and in vitro\ndiagnostic test systems, for use in this International Standard. Annex I on toxicological hazards has been\ntaken from Annex B of ISO 14971-1 with only minor changes.\nCOPYRIGHT Danish Standards. NOT FOR COMMERCIAL USE OR REPRODUCTION.

The identification should be based upon the safety characteristics identified in 4.2.\nA.2.4.4\nEstimation of the risk(s) for each hazardous situation\nA risk can only be assessed and managed once a hazardous situation has been identified. Documenting the\nreasonably foreseeable sequences of events that can transform a hazard into a hazardous situation allows\nthis to be done systematically.\nAnnex E is provided to help manufacturers identify hazards and hazardous situations by listing typical hazards\nand giving examples to demonstrate the relationships between hazards, foreseeable sequences of events,\nhazardous situations and associated possible harm. This is especially important when there is a sequence of\nevents that can lead to a hazardous situation and maybe in the end to harm. The manufacturer should\nrecognise and identify these sequences of events in order to address risk properly (see Figure E.1).\nThe list as given in Annex E is non-exhaustive and is not intended as a checklist, but rather to stimulate\ncreative thinking.\nThis is the final step of risk analysis. The difficulty of this step is that estimation of risk is different for every\nhazardous situation that is under investigation as well as for every medical device. Therefore, this subclause\nwas written generically. Because hazards can occur both when the medical device functions normally and\nwhen it malfunctions, one should look closely at both situations. In practice, both components of risk,\nprobability and consequence, should be analysed separately. When a manufacturer uses a systematic way of\ncategorizing the severity levels or probability of occurrence of harm, the categorization scheme should be\ndefined and recorded in the risk management file. This enables the manufacturer to treat equivalent risks\nconsistently and serves as evidence that the manufacturer has done so.\nSome hazardous situations occur because of systematic faults or sequences of events. There is no\nconsensus on how to calculate the probability of a systematic fault. Where the probability of occurrence of\nharm cannot be calculated, hazards still have to be addressed and listing resulting hazardous situations\nseparately allows the manufacturer to focus on reducing the risks due to these hazardous situations.\nFrequently, good quantitative data are not readily available. The suggestion that estimation of risk should be\ndone only in a quantitative way has therefore been avoided.\nAnnex D has been provided as helpful guidance on risk analysis. The information originates from several\nsources, including IEC 60300-3-9[21]. This International Standard recognised the usefulness of\nIEC 60300-3-9[21] and extended it to apply to all medical devices and all phases of the risk management\nprocess. Although risk charts and risk matrices are used extensively in Annex D as examples, this\nInternational Standard does not require their use.\nA.2.5 Risk evaluation\nDecisions have to be made about the acceptability of risk. Manufacturers can use the recently estimated risks\nand evaluate them using the criteria for risk acceptability defined in the risk management plan. They can\nscreen the risks to determine which ones need to be reduced. Clause 5 was carefully worded to allow the user\nof this International Standard to avoid unnecessary work.\nA.2.6 Risk control\nA.2.6.1\nRisk reduction\nIt is intended that steps 6.2 to 6.7 make up a logical sequence of stages. This systematic approach is\nimportant since it ensures that relevant information is available when required.\nCOPYRIGHT Danish Standards. NOT FOR COMMERCIAL USE OR REPRODUCTION.

There are three mechanisms listed:\na)\ninherent safety by design;\nb)\nprotective measures in the medical device itself or in the manufacturing process;\nc)\ninformation for safety.\nThese are all standard risk reduction measures and are derived from ISO/IEC Guide 51[2]. The priority order\nlisted is important. This principle is found in several places, including IEC/TR 60513[22] and local or regional\nregulations (e.g. the European Medical Device Directive[34]). If practicable, the medical device should be\ndesigned to be inherently safe. If this is not practicable, then protective measures such as barriers or alarms\nare appropriate. The least preferred protective measure is a written warning or contra-indication.\nIt is recognised that one possible result of the risk control option analysis could be that there is no practicable\nway of reducing the risk to acceptable levels according to the pre-established criteria for risk acceptability. For\nexample, it could be impractical to design a life-supporting medical device with such an acceptable residual\nrisk. In this case, a risk/benefit analysis can be carried out as described in 6.5 to determine whether the\nbenefit of the medical device, to the patient, outweighs the residual risk. This option is included at this point in\nthe standard to make sure that every effort was first made to reduce risks to the pre-established acceptable\nlevels.\nA.2.6.3\nImplementation of risk control measures\nTwo distinct verifications are included. The first verification is required to make sure that the risk control\nmeasure has been implemented in the final design. The second verification is required to ensure that the\nmeasure as implemented actually reduces the risk. In some instances, a validation study can be used for\nverifying the effectiveness of the risk control measure.\nA.2.6.4\nResidual risk evaluation\nA check was introduced here to determine whether the implemented measures have made the risk acceptable.\nIf the risk is not less than the criteria established in the risk management plan, manufacturers are instructed to\nassess additional risk control measures. This iterative procedure should be continued until the risk is reduced\nto within the acceptable levels established in the risk management plan.\nThe user should be provided with relevant information on residual risks so that the user can make informed\ndecisions. However, it is the manufacturer's decision as to what and how much information on residual risk\nshould be provided. This requirement is consistent with the approach taken in many countries and regions.\nA.2.6.5\nRisk/benefit analysis\nThere will be some occasions where the risk of a medical device is greater than the manufacturer\u2019s criteria for\nacceptable risk. This subclause enables the manufacturer to provide a high-risk medical device for which they\nhave done a careful evaluation and can show that the benefit of the medical device outweighs the risk. It is\nimportant for users to be informed of significant residual risks and resulting benefits so that informed decisions\ncan be made. See Annex J.\nA.2.6.6\nRisks arising from risk control measures\nThis subclause recognises that risk control measures alone or in combination might introduce a new and\nsometimes quite different hazard and that measures introduced to reduce one risk might increase another risk.\nCOPYRIGHT Danish Standards.

This check was introduced to ensure that\nno hazards were left out in the intricacies of a complex risk analysis.\nA.2.7 Evaluation of overall residual risk acceptability\nDuring the process defined by Clauses 4 to 6, manufacturers identify hazards, evaluate the risks, and\nimplement risk control measures in their design one at a time. This is the point where the manufacturer has to\nstep back, consider the combined impact of the individual residual risks, and make a decision as to whether to\nproceed with the medical device. It is possible that the overall residual risk can exceed the manufacturer\u2019s\ncriteria for acceptable risk, even though individual residual risks do not. This is particularly true for complex\nsystems and medical devices with a large number of risks. Even if the overall residual risk exceeds the criteria\nin the risk management plan, the manufacturer has an opportunity to do an overall risk/benefit evaluation to\ndetermine whether a high-risk, but highly beneficial, medical device should be marketed. It is important for\nusers to be informed of significant overall residual risks. Thus, manufacturers are instructed to include\npertinent information in the accompanying documents.\nA.2.8 Risk management report\nThe risk management report is a crucial part of the risk management file. It is intended to be a summary of the\nreview of the final results of the risk management process. The report serves as the high level document that\nprovides evidence that the manufacturer has ensured that the risk management plan has been satisfactorily\nfulfilled and results confirm that the required objective has been achieved. The first edition required that\ntraceability be part of the risk management report. This requirement was deleted because for complex devices\nand analyses traceability makes the risk management report much more extensive than was originally\nenvisioned by the Joint Working Group 1. Traceability still has to be part of the risk management file, and so\n3.5 was modified to require this.\nA.2.9 Production and post-production information\nIt cannot be emphasised too often that risk management does not stop when a medical device goes into\nproduction. Risk management often begins with an idea where there is no physical manifestation of the\nmedical device. Risk estimates can be refined throughout the design process and made more accurate when\na functioning prototype is built. Information for use in risk management can come from any source, including\nproduction or quality records. However, no amount of modelling can substitute for an actual medical device in\nthe hands of actual users. Therefore, the manufacturers should monitor production and post-production\ninformation for data and information that can affect their risk estimates and, consequently, their risk\nmanagement decisions. The manufacturer should also take into account state-of-the-art considerations and\nthe practicability of applying them. The information should also be used to improve the risk management\nprocess. With the post-production information the risk management process truly becomes an iterative closed-\nloop process.\nIn this second edition of this International Standard, the title of this section has been changed from \u201cPost-\nproduction information\u201d to \u201cProduction and post production information\u201d in recognition of the fact that important\nrisk management information can be acquired as early as the initiation of manufacturing of a device. The\nrequirements in the clause have also been rewritten to emphasise the sequence of steps expected of the\nmanufacturer.\nCOPYRIGHT Danish Standards. NOT FOR COMMERCIAL USE OR REPRODUCTION.

Consideration of these characteristics is an essential step in identifying the hazards of the\nmedical device as required in 4.3. One way of doing this is to ask a series of questions concerning the\nmanufacture, intended users, intended use, reasonably foreseeable misuse, and ultimate disposal of the\nmedical device. If one asks these questions from the point of view of all the individuals involved (e.g., users,\nmaintainers, patients, etc.), a more complete picture can emerge of where the hazards can be found. The\nfollowing questions can aid the reader in identifying all the characteristics of the medical device that could\naffect safety. H.2.5.4 contains points to consider in estimating risk to the patient from IVD medical devices.\nThe list is not exhaustive, or representative of all medical devices, and the reader is advised to add questions\nthat can have applicability to the particular medical device and to skip questions that are not relevant to the\nparticular medical device. The reader is also advised to consider each question not only on its own but also in\nrelation to others.\nC.2 Questions\nC.2.1 What is the intended use and how is the medical device to be used?\nFactors that should be considered include:\n\u007f what is the medical device's role relative to\n\u007f diagnosis, prevention, monitoring, treatment or alleviation of disease,\n\u007f compensation for injury or handicap or\n\u007f replacement or modification of anatomy, or control of conception?\n\u007f what are the indications for use (e.g. patient population)?\n\u007f does the medical device sustain or support life?\n\u007f is special intervention necessary in the case of failure of the medical device?\nC.2.2 Is the medical device intended to be implanted?\nFactors that should be considered include the location of implantation, the characteristics of the patient\npopulation, age, weight, physical activity, the effect of ageing on implant performance, the expected lifetime of\nthe implant, the reversibility of the implantation.\nCOPYRIGHT Danish Standards.

A sequence of events includes both a single event and combinations\nof events. A hazardous situation occurs when people, property or the environment are exposed to a hazard.\nAnnex C provides guidance in the form of questions on characteristics of medical devices that can help in\nidentifying hazards. Annex E provides guidance on identifying hazards and sequences of events that can lead\nto a hazardous situation. Annex H provides guidance on identifying hazards and sequences of events that can\nlead to hazardous situations and harm for in vitro diagnostic medical devices.\nIt needs to be emphasised that hazardous situations can arise even when there are no faults, i.e. in the\nnormal condition for the medical device.\nD.2.2 Hazardous situations arising from faults\nD.2.2.1\nGeneral\nIn cases where a hazardous situation only occurs due to a fault, the probability of a fault is not the same as\nthe probability of the occurrence of harm. A fault does not always result in a hazardous situation, and a\nhazardous situation does not always result in harm.\nCOPYRIGHT Danish Standards. NOT FOR COMMERCIAL USE OR REPRODUCTION.

It is\nimportant to understand that there are generally two types of fault that can lead to a hazardous situation:\nrandom and systematic faults.\nD.2.2.2\nHazardous situations resulting from random faults\nFor many events, a numerical value can be given for the probability that the fault will occur. Some examples of\nrandom faults are given below.\n\u007f The failure of a part such as an integrated circuit in an electronic assembly.\n\u007f The contamination of an IVD reagent leading to incorrect results due to deterioration over time.\n\u007f The presence of an infectious or toxic substance in or on a medical device. A quantitative estimate can\nonly be applied to biological risks if sufficient information is known about the hazard and the\ncircumstances affecting the probability of the hazardous situation occurring, for example in the use of\nsterility assurance levels. This situation would be treated in the same way as a random fault for hardware.\nIn many other instances the presence of an infectious or toxic substance would have to be treated as a\nsystematic fault (see D.2.2.3). The risk arising from the presence of a toxic substance in a device material\nshould be estimated in line with ISO 10993-17[7]. This can provide assurance that the degree of exposure\nanticipated from the use of the device is lower than that likely to cause harm to health.\nD.2.2.3\nHazardous situations resulting from systematic faults\nA systematic fault can be caused by an error in any activity. It will systematically give rise to a failure when\nsome particular combination of inputs or environmental conditions arises, but will otherwise remain latent.\nErrors leading to systematic faults can occur in both hardware and software and can be introduced at any time\nduring a medical device\u2019s development, manufacture or maintenance. Some examples of systematic faults\nare:\n\u007f an incorrectly rated fuse fails to prevent a hazardous situation: the fuse rating might have been incorrectly\nspecified, or the fuse is incorrectly fitted during manufacture or incorrectly replaced during repair;\n\u007f a software database does not provide for the condition of full database: if the database is full, it is not\nclear what the software will do; a possible consequence is that the system will simply replace existing\nrecords with new ones;\n\u007f a fluid, used during the production of a medical device, has a boiling point lower than body temperature:\nresidues of the fluid can, in certain circumstances, be introduced into the blood, possibly leading to an\nembolism;\n\u007f the antibody in a hepatitis assay does not detect some (new) variants of the virus;\n\u007f inadequate environmental control, or a breakdown in environmental control systems, leads to\ncontamination with a toxic substance or an infectious agent.\nThe accurate estimation of systematic fault rates is difficult. This occurs primarily for the following reasons.\n\u007f Systematic fault rates are laborious and expensive to measure. Achieving a reasonable level of\nconfidence in the result will not be possible without extensive data on fault rates or parameters relevant to\nrisk control.\n\u007f Consensus does not exist for a method of estimating systematic fault rates quantitatively.\nBecause risk estimation is difficult in these circumstances, the emphasis should be on the implementation of\nrobust systems to prevent hazardous situations from arising.\nCOPYRIGHT Danish Standards.

While this International Standard does not require that a\nparticular method be used, it does require that risk estimation be carried out (see 4.4). Quantitative risk\nestimation is preferable when suitable data are available; however, without suitable data, qualitative methods\nof risk estimation can suffice.\nThe concept of risk is the combination of the following two components:\n\u007f the probability of occurrence of harm;\n\u007f the consequences of that harm, i.e., how severe it might be.\nRisk estimation should examine, for example:\n\u007f the initiating event or circumstance (see E.3);\n\u007f the sequence of events that could lead to a hazardous situation occurring;\n\u007f the likelihood of such a situation arising;\n\u007f the likelihood that the hazardous situation leads to harm;\n\u007f the nature of the harm that could result.\nDepending on the area of application, only certain elements of the risk estimation process need be considered.\nFor example, in some instances, when the harm is minimal or when the probability cannot be estimated, it will\nnot be necessary to go beyond an initial hazard and consequence analysis.\nRisk should be expressed in terms that facilitate risk control decision making, for example, using harms and\nprobability scales and units that will mirror actual use. In order to analyse risks, their components, i.e.\nprobability and severity, should be analysed separately.\nA risk chart such as that shown in Figure D.1 can provide a depiction of the estimated risks, which is useful for\nlater decision making. The risks would be plotted on the chart as they are estimated. Risk matrices developed\nfrom Figure D.1 will be used in examples throughout this annex. This does not imply that this method has\ngeneral applicability to medical devices; however, it can be useful in many instances. If a risk chart or risk\nmatrix is used for ranking risks, the particular risk chart or risk matrix and the interpretation used should be\njustified for that application.\nD.3.2 Probability\nD.3.2.1\nGeneral\nIn situations where sufficient data are available, a quantitative categorization of probability levels is preferred.\nIf this is not possible, the manufacturer should give a qualitative description. A good qualitative description is\npreferable to an inaccurate quantitative description. For a qualitative categorization of probability levels, the\nmanufacturer can use descriptors appropriate for the medical device.\nD.3.2.2\nProbability estimation\nAlthough probability is in reality a continuum, in practice a discrete number of levels can be used. In this case,\nthe manufacturer decides how many probability levels are needed, based upon the expected confidence in the\nestimates. With greater confidence, a greater number of probability levels can be used. At least three levels\nshould be used to facilitate decision making. The levels can be descriptive (e.g. not expected to occur during\nCOPYRIGHT Danish Standards. NOT FOR COMMERCIAL USE OR REPRODUCTION.

Manufacturers should define the categories explicitly so that there will be no confusion over what is\nmeant. A particularly effective way is to assign a range of numerical values to the discrete levels.\nProbability estimation will encompass the circumstances and entire sequence of events from the occurrence\nof the initiating cause through to the occurrence of harm. Implicit in the consideration of the probability of harm\nis the concept of exposure. For example, if there is no exposure to a hazard, there can be no harm. Therefore\nthe probability of harm should take into consideration the level or extent of exposure. This includes answering\nthe following types of question.\n\u007f Does the hazardous situation occur in the absence of a failure?\n\u007f Does the hazardous situation occur in a fault condition?\n\u007f Does the hazardous situation occur only in a multiple-fault condition?\n\u007f How likely is it that a hazardous situation will lead to harm?\nThe likelihood that a hazardous situation will lead to harm is influenced by the life-cycle of the medical device\nand estimated number of devices in the market.\nSeven approaches are commonly employed to estimate probabilities:\n\u007f use of relevant historical data;\n\u007f prediction of probabilities using analytical or simulation techniques;\n\u007f use of experimental data;\n\u007f reliability estimates;\n\u007f production data;\n\u007f post-production information;\n\u007f use of expert judgment.\nAll these approaches can be used individually or jointly. The first three approaches are complementary; each\nhas strength where the other has weaknesses. Wherever possible, multiple approaches should be used. In\nthis way, they work as independent checks on each other, and this might serve to increase confidence in the\nresults. When these approaches cannot be used or are not sufficient, it might be necessary to rely only on\nexpert judgment.\nD.3.2.3\nRisks whose probability cannot be estimated\nConfidence in a risk estimate is enhanced when a quantitative estimate of the probability of occurrence can be\nmade on the basis of accurate and reliable data or when a reasonable qualitative estimate is possible.\nHowever, this is not always achievable. For example, the probabilities of systematic faults, such as those\ndiscussed in D.2.2.3, are extremely difficult to estimate. When the accuracy of the probability estimate is in\ndoubt, it is often necessary to establish a broad range for the probability, or determine that it is no worse than\nsome particular value. Examples where probabilities are very difficult to estimate include:\n\u007f software failure;\n\u007f situations, such as sabotage or tampering with a medical device;\n\u007f novel hazards that are poorly understood: e.g. imprecise knowledge of the infectivity of the causative\nagent of Bovine Spongiform Encephalopathy (BSE) prevents quantification of the risk of transmission;\n\u007f certain toxicological hazards, such as genotoxic carcinogens and sensitizing agents, where it might not\nbe possible to determine a threshold of exposure below which toxic effects do not occur.\nCOPYRIGHT Danish Standards.

If it can\nbe concluded that the hazard is of little practical consequence, the risk can be judged to be acceptable and no\nrisk control measures are necessary. However, for significant hazards, that is, hazards which could inflict\nharm of high severity such as those noted above, no level of exposure can be identified that corresponds to a\nrisk so low that there is no need to bother about it. In such cases, the risk estimate should be made on the\nbasis of a reasonable worst-case estimate of probability. In some instances, it is convenient to set this default\nvalue of the probability to one and to base risk control measures on preventing the hazard entirely, reducing\nthe probability of harm to an acceptable level or in reducing the severity of the harm (see D.4).\nIt is usually assumed that there is an inverse relationship between the rigors of the processes used in the\ndesign and development of complex systems and the probability of systematic faults being introduced or\nremaining undetected. It is often appropriate to determine the required rigor of the development process by\ntaking account of the severity of the consequence of the systematic faults and the effect of risk control\nmeasures external to the medical device. The worse the consequence and the less the effect of external risk\ncontrol measures, the higher the required rigor of the development process.\nD.3.3 Severity\nTo categorize the severity of the potential harm, the manufacturer should use descriptors appropriate for the\nmedical device. Severity is, in reality, a continuum; however, in practice, the use of a discrete number of\nseverity levels simplifies the analysis. In such cases, the manufacturer decides how many categories are\nneeded and how they are to be defined. The levels can be descriptive (e.g., does not require medical\nintervention, requires medical intervention, requires hospitalization, causes death, etc.). They can also be\nsymbolic (S1, S2, etc.), but, in this case, each symbol should be explicitly defined. In either case, they should\nnot include any element of probability. See the examples in D.3.4.\nSeverity levels will need to be chosen and justified by the manufacturer for a particular medical device under\nclearly defined conditions of use.\nD.3.4 Examples\nD.3.4.1\nQualitative analyses\nSeveral approaches can be used for qualitative analysis. A typical approach is to use an N-by-M matrix to\ndescribe the probabilities and severities of the risk associated with each hazardous situation. One carefully\ndefines N levels of probability and M levels of severity. Each cell of the matrix represents a subset of the full\nset of possible risks. Cells are created by partitioning the range of possible probabilities and the range of\npossible consequences. A simple example is a 3 u 3 matrix based upon the definitions in Tables D.1 and D.2.\nManufacturers should make these definitions as device-specific and explicit as needed to ensure their\nreproducible use.\nTable D.1 \u2014 Examples of qualitative severity level\nCommon terms\nPossible description\nSignificant\nDeath or loss of function or structure\nModerate\nReversible or minor injury\nNegligible\nWill not cause injury or will injure slightly\n\nTable D.2 \u2014 Simplified examples of qualitative probability levels\nCommon terms\nPossible description\nHigh\nLikely to happen, often, frequent\nMedium\nCan happen, but not frequently\nLow\nUnlikely to happen, rare, remote\nCOPYRIGHT Danish Standards.

The scale is semi-quantitative because the value for\nprobability has not been precisely determined but is known to be within an estimated range (such as an order\nof magnitude). Judgments are made on the relative values for the severity levels, but no attempt is made to\nprovide a numeric scale. In practice, severity is seldom quantified because of the difficulty in comparing the\nvalue of a death to the value of a permanent disability or the value of an injury that requires a surgical\nintervention.\nIn this example, a 5 u 5 risk matrix is used. The levels of probability and severity are defined in Tables D.3 and\nD.4 respectively.\nTable D.3 \u2014 Example of five qualitative severity levels\nCommon terms\nPossible description\nCatastrophic\nResults in patient death\nCritical\nResults in permanent impairment or life-threatening\ninjury\nSerious\nResults in injury or impairment requiring professional\nmedical intervention\nMinor\nResults in temporary injury or impairment not requiring\nprofessional medical intervention\nNegligible\nInconvenience or temporary discomfort\nTable D.4 \u2014 Example of semi-quantitative probability levels\nCommon terms\nExamples of probability range\nFrequent\nW 10\u00103\nProbable\n10\u00103 and W 10\u00104\nOccasional\n10\u00104 and W 10\u00105\nRemote\n10\u00105 and W 10\u00106\nImprobable\n10\u00106\nThe definitions for probability can be different for different product families. For example, a manufacturer can\nchoose to use one set of definitions for X-ray machines, but can have a different set of definitions for sterile\ndisposable dressings. Different measures of probability will be appropriate, depending upon the application.\nScales for probability can include \u201cprobability of harm per use,\u201d \u201cprobability of harm per device,\u201d \u201cprobability of\nharm per hour of use,\u201d etc.\nCOPYRIGHT Danish Standards.

To meet the expectations of public opinion, it might be necessary to give\nadditional weighting to some risks. In some cases, the only option could be to consider that identified\nstakeholder concerns reflect the values of society and that these concerns have been taken into account\nwhen the manufacturer has used the methods listed above.\nOne way of applying acceptability criteria is by indicating in a matrix such as Figure D.4 and Figure D.5 which\ncombinations of probability of harm and severity of harm are acceptable or unacceptable.

In these\ninstances, techniques such as Hazard Analysis of Critical Control Points (HACCP) can be useful (see G.6).\nD.5.5 Standards and risk control\nBy applying a standard, the manufacturer can simplify the task of analysing the remaining residual risk, but it\nneeds to be emphasised that standards might not address all the risks associated with a device.\nMany standards address inherent safety, protective measures, and information for safety for medical devices.\nWhen relevant safety standards exist, they can address some or all of the risks that need to be dealt with for a\nparticular medical device. It is presumed that, in the absence of objective evidence to the contrary, meeting\nthe requirements of the relevant standards results in particular risks being reduced to an acceptable level, but\nthe responsibility for verifying that this is the case for a particular device rests with the manufacturer.\nCOPYRIGHT Danish Standards.

A risk/benefit analysis is\nused to justify a risk once all practicable measures to reduce the risk have been applied. If, after applying\nthese measures, the risk is still not judged acceptable, a risk/benefit analysis is needed to establish whether\nthe medical device is likely to provide more benefit than harm.\nGenerally, if all practicable risk control measures are insufficient to satisfy the risk acceptability criteria in the\nrisk management plan, the design shall be abandoned. In some instances, however, greater risks can be\njustified, if they are outweighed by the expected benefits of using the device. This International Standard\nallows manufacturers an opportunity to do a risk/benefit analysis to determine whether the residual risk is\nacceptable based on benefit.\nThe decision as to whether risks are outweighed by benefits is essentially a matter of judgment by\nexperienced and knowledgeable individuals. An important consideration in the acceptability of a residual risk\nis whether an anticipated clinical benefit can be achieved through the use of alternative design solutions or\ntherapeutic options that avoid exposure to that risk or reduce the overall risk. The practicability of further risk\nreduction should be taken into account before considering benefit (see D.8.4). This International Standard\nexplains how risks can be characterized so that a risk estimate can be determined with confidence.\nUnfortunately, there is no standardized approach to estimate benefit.\nD.6.2 Benefit estimation\nThe benefit arising from a medical device is related to the likelihood and extent of improvement of health\nexpected from its use. Benefit can be estimated from knowledge of such things as:\n\u007f the performance expected during clinical use;\n\u007f the clinical outcome expected from that performance;\n\u007f factors relevant to the risks and benefits of other treatment options.\nConfidence in the benefit estimate is strongly dependent on the reliability of evidence addressing these factors.\nThis includes recognition that there is likely to be a range of possible outcomes and factors such as the\nfollowing that need to be taken into account.\n\u007f It will be difficult to compare different outcomes, e.g. which is worse, pain or loss of mobility? Different\noutcomes can result from the side effects being very different from the initial problem.\n\u007f It is difficult to take account of non-stable outcomes. These can arise both from the recovery time and\nlong-term effects.\nBecause of the difficulties in a rigorous approach, it is generally necessary to make simplifying assumptions.\nTherefore, it will usually prove expedient to focus on the most likely outcomes for each option and those that\nare the most favourable or unfavourable.\nAn estimate of clinical benefit can vary markedly between different stages of the design cycle. If reliable\nclinical data demonstrating the consistent performance and effectiveness of the product are available, the\nclinical benefit can be estimated confidently. In cases where clinical data are limited in quantity or quality,\nbenefit is estimated with greater uncertainty from whatever relevant information is available. For example, it is\nsometimes necessary early in the process to estimate the expected degree of improvement to health from the\ndesign intention; however, in the absence of relevant clinical data, the likelihood of achieving the intended\nperformance and the desired clinical effect will have to be predicted by reference to quality assurance\nmeasures and in vitro or in vivo performance characteristics.\nCOPYRIGHT Danish Standards.

This is essential to confirm that the risk/benefit balance is as expected and to prevent\nunwarranted exposure of patients to a large residual risk. ISO 14155-1[10] and ISO 14155-2[11] specify\nprocedures for the conduct and performance of clinical investigations of medical devices.\nD.6.3 Criteria for risk/benefit judgments\nThose involved in making risk/benefit judgments have a responsibility to understand and take into account the\ntechnical, clinical, regulatory, economic, sociological and political context of their risk management decisions.\nThis can involve an interpretation of fundamental requirements set out in applicable regulations or standards,\nas they apply to the product in question under the anticipated conditions of use. Since this type of analysis is\nhighly product-specific, further guidance of a general nature is not possible. Instead, the safety requirements\nspecified by standards addressing specific products or risks can be presumed to be consistent with an\nacceptable level of risk, especially where the use of those standards is sanctioned by the prevailing regulatory\nsystem. Note that a clinical investigation, in accordance with a legally recognised procedure, might be\nrequired to verify that the balance between medical benefit and residual risk is acceptable.\nD.6.4 Risk/benefit comparison\nA direct comparison of risks and benefits is only valid if a common scale is used. When a common scale is\nused, the risk to benefit comparison can be evaluated quantitatively. Indirect risk/benefit comparisons do not\nuse a common scale and are evaluated qualitatively. Whether quantitative or qualitative, risk/benefit\ncomparisons should take the following into account.\n\u007f Initially, a literature search for the hazard(s) and product class in question can provide significant insight\ninto the ratio of benefit to risk.\n\u007f High-benefit/high-risk devices usually represent the best available technology that provides a medical\nbenefit but does not completely eliminate risk of injury or illness. Therefore, an understanding of current\ntechnology as it relates to medical practice is required for accurate risk/benefit analysis. The risk/benefit\ncomparison can be expressed in terms of a comparison to other marketed products.\n\u007f To validate that a device meets acceptable risk/benefit criteria, clinical testing is often required. Clinical\ntesting can quantify benefits and risks. Also, acceptability to society could be addressed in a clinical study,\ni.e., patients, users, medical practitioners.\n\u007f For high-risk/high-benefit devices, labelling should convey adequate information to appropriate users,\npatients, and medical practitioners to ensure appropriate risk/benefit decisions are made by individuals\nprior to use.\n\u007f High-risk/high-benefit devices typically have additional regulatory requirements that have to be achieved\nprior to marketing.\nPrior to launching a new or revised product requiring a risk/benefit analysis, the manufacturer should\nsummarise the available information related to the risk/benefit determination and document the risk/benefit\nconclusions with rationales as applicable. Guidance on conducting a literature search of clinical data can be\nfound in Annex A of ISO 14155-1:2003[10].\nD.6.5 Examples of risk/benefit decisions\nExample 1: Burns can occur where the return electrode of a high-frequency surgery device is improperly\nattached to the patient. Although conformance to the relevant product standard minimizes the probability of\nsuch burns, they still occur. Nevertheless, the benefit of using a high-frequency surgery device as compared\nto other surgical techniques outweighs the residual risk of burns.\nCOPYRIGHT Danish Standards.

However, the unwanted effects of radiation on\nthe patient are not ignored. Standards exist to minimize unnecessary radiation exposure to patients,\nembodying the risk/benefit decision. When a new application of ionizing radiation to diagnostic imaging is\ncontemplated and existing standards are not applicable, the manufacturer should verify that the results of the\nrisk/benefit analysis are at least as favourable as that of alternative products and treatments.\nExample 3: Once implanted, some cochlear implant components, such as the implant receiver stimulator with\nelectrode array, cannot easily be replaced. They are intended to remain implanted for life and are required to\nperform reliably for years and even decades. (This is an especially important consideration in the case of a\nyoung adult or child.) Accelerated reliability testing of these components can be conducted for specific failure\nmechanisms. However, validating the reliability of components that are to last for decades is not practical.\nTherefore, the overall residual risk including the risk of device failure is weighed against the benefit afforded\nby the potential for hearing improvement. The overall residual risk will depend on the estimated reliability of\nthe components and the confidence that can be given to the reliability estimates for those components that\ncannot be validated. In some cases the residual risk will outweigh the benefit; in other cases the benefit will\noutweigh the risk.\nD.7 Overall residual risk evaluation\nD.7.1 General\nOverall residual risk evaluation is the point where residual risk is viewed from a broad perspective. The\nmanufacturer shall consider how to evaluate the remaining residual risk with respect to the acceptability\ncriteria.\nOverall residual risk evaluation needs to be performed by persons with the knowledge, experience, and\nauthority to perform such tasks. It is often desirable to involve application specialists with knowledge of and\nexperience with the medical device (see 3.3).\nThere is no preferred method for evaluating overall residual risk and the manufacturer is responsible for\ndetermining an appropriate method. Some possible techniques are listed together with considerations\naffecting their selection.\nD.7.2 Event tree analysis\nA specific sequence of events can lead to several different individual risks, each of which contributes to the\noverall residual risk. For example, the re-use of a single-use device can be associated with re-infection,\nleaching of toxic substances, mechanical failure due to ageing and bio-incompatible disinfectant residues. An\nevent tree can be a suitable method for analysing these risks. The individual residual risks need to be\nconsidered together to determine if the overall residual risk is acceptable.\nD.7.3 Review for conflicting requirements\nRisk control measures that are appropriate for individual risks can result in conflicting requirements, e.g. a\nwarning to address the risk of an unconscious patient falling off a patient table could be \u201cnever leave an\nunconscious patient unattended\u201d; this could conflict with a warning \u201cmake X-ray exposure away from the\npatient\u201d intended to protect an operator from being exposed to X-rays.\nD.7.4 Fault tree analysis\nHarm to a patient or user can originate from different hazardous situations (see Annex E). In such cases, the\nprobability of the harm used to determine the overall residual risk is based on a combination of the individual\nprobabilities. A fault tree analysis can be a suitable method for deriving the combined probability of harm.\nCOPYRIGHT Danish Standards. NOT FOR COMMERCIAL USE OR REPRODUCTION.

Analysis might be needed to assess if there is an over-reliance on\nwarnings and the impact that such over-reliance could have on the risk reduction and on the overall residual\nrisk.\nD.7.6 Review of the operating instructions\nA consideration of all the operating instructions for the device might discover that information is inconsistent or\ntoo difficult to follow.\nD.7.7 Compare risks\nAnother method would be to compare the collated individual residual risks posed by the device against that for\nsimilar existing devices, e.g. risk by risk taking account of different contexts of use. Care should be taken in\nsuch comparisons to use up-to-date information on adverse events for the existing devices.\nD.7.8 Review by application experts\nAn assessment of the benefits to the patient associated with the use of the device can be required in order to\ndemonstrate acceptability of the device. One approach could be to get a fresh view of the overall residual risk\nby using application specialists that were not directly involved in the development of the device. The\napplication specialists would evaluate the acceptability of the overall residual risks considering aspects such\nas usability by using the device in a representative clinical environment. Then, evaluation of the device in the\nclinical environment could confirm the acceptability.\nD.8 As-low-as-reasonably-practicable approach\nD.8.1 General\nWhen establishing the risk acceptability policy, the manufacturer might find it convenient to use an as-low-as-\nreasonably-practicable approach.\nAfter a particular risk control option has been applied, there are three possible results:\na)\nthe residual risk exceeds the manufacturer\u2019s criterion for risk acceptability;\nb)\nthe residual risk is acceptable because it is so small as to be negligible\nor\nc)\nthe residual risk is between the two states specified in a) and b); for these risks the residual risk is\nacceptable for the option that reduces the risk to the lowest practicable level, bearing in mind the benefits\nresulting from its acceptance and taking into account the costs of any further reduction.\nThe as-low-as-reasonably-practicable approach can be used as part of risk control options analysis (6.2).\nRisks for which the probability cannot be estimated would normally use the as-low-as-reasonably-practicable\napproach.\nD.8.2 Risk levels\nBelow a certain level the residual risk will be regarded as so insignificant that it is comparable with the\neveryday risks we all experience and tolerate. Such risks can be called negligible.\nCOPYRIGHT Danish Standards. NOT FOR COMMERCIAL USE OR REPRODUCTION.

This decision is made once for each risk.\nD.8.3 Risk control option analysis\nRisk reduction options are investigated for each risk that is not negligible. Risk reduction might or might not be\npracticable, but it should be considered. The possible outcomes are:\n\u007f one or more risk control measures brings the risk down to an insignificant level and it is not necessary to\nconsider it further\nor\n\u007f whether or not some risk reduction is possible, reducing the risk to an insignificant level is not practicable.\nAny specific residual risk that remains after the risk control measures are applied should be evaluated using\nthe criteria defined in the risk management plan. If the residual risk does not exceed the manufacturer\u2019s\ncriterion for risk acceptability and the as-low-as-reasonably-practicable approach has been applied, then no\nfurther risk reduction is necessary.\nD.8.4 Practicability considerations\nIt might be thought that any risk associated with a medical device would be acceptable if the patient\u2019s\nprognosis were improved. This cannot be used as a rationale for the acceptance of unnecessary risk. All risks\nshould be reduced to the lowest level practicable, bearing in mind the state of the art and the benefits of\naccepting the risk and the practicability of further reduction.\nPracticability refers to the ability of a manufacturer to reduce the risk. Practicability has two components:\n\u007f technical practicability;\n\u007f economic practicability.\nTechnical practicability refers to the ability to reduce the risk regardless of cost. The following are a few\nexamples where technical practicability is questionable:\n\u007f including so many warning/caution labels that the user is hampered in operating the medical device;\n\u007f multiple alarms that create confusion;\n\u007f communicating too many residual risks so that the operator has difficulty understanding which ones are\nreally important;\n\u007f overly complex procedures for using the medical device so that the intended use is compromised;\n\u007f using risk control measures that compromise the intended use (e.g. reducing the power of an\nelectrosurgical unit below its effective level).\nEconomic practicability refers to the ability to reduce the risk without making the medical device an unsound\neconomic proposition. These decisions necessarily involve making trade-offs between accepting risks and\navailability of treatments or diagnosis. Cost and availability implications are considered in deciding what is\npracticable to the extent that these impact upon the preservation, promotion or improvement of human health.\nHowever, economic practicability should not be used as a rationale for the acceptance of unnecessary risk.\nThe following is an example in which economic practicability is questionable:\nCOPYRIGHT Danish Standards.

Subclause 4.4 requires the manufacturer to consider\nthe foreseeable sequences of events that can produce hazardous situations and harm. According to the\ndefinitions, a hazard cannot result in harm until such time as a sequence of events or other circumstances\n(including normal use) lead to a hazardous situation. At this stage the risk can be assessed by estimating both\nseverity and probability of occurrence of harm that could result (see Figure E.1).\n\nNOTE\nP1 is the probability of a hazardous situation occurring.\n\nP2 is the probability of a hazardous situation leading to harm.\nFigure E.1 \u2014 Pictorial representation of the relationship of hazard,\nsequence of events, hazardous situation and harm\nA good starting point for this compilation is a review of experience with the same and similar types of device.\nThe review should take into account a manufacturer\u2019s own experience as well as the experience of other\nmanufacturers as reported in adverse event databases, publications and other available sources. This type of\nreview is particularly useful for the identification and listing of typical hazardous situations for a device and the\nassociated harm that can occur. Next, this listing and aids such as the list of examples in Table E.1 can be\nused to compile an initial list of hazards.\nCOPYRIGHT Danish Standards. NOT FOR COMMERCIAL USE OR REPRODUCTION.

Since many hazards might never result in harm and can be\neliminated from further consideration, it could be useful to perform this analysis by starting with the harm the\ndevice might cause and work backwards from there. However, although this approach is useful for the reason\ndescribed, it should be recognised that it is not a thorough analysis. Many sequences of events will only be\nidentified by the systematic use of risk analysis techniques such as those described in Annex G. Analysis and\nidentification are further complicated by the many initiating events and circumstances that have to be taken\ninto consideration such as those listed in Table E.2. Thus, more than one risk analysis technique, and\nsometimes the use of complementary techniques, are needed to complete a comprehensive analysis.\nTable E.3 provides examples of the relationship between hazards, sequences of events, hazardous situations,\nand harm.\nAlthough compilation of the lists of hazards, hazardous situations, and sequences should be completed as\nearly as possible in the design and development process to facilitate risk control, in practice identification and\ncompilation is an ongoing activity that continues throughout post-production.\nThis annex provides a non-exhaustive list of possible hazards that can be associated with different medical\ndevices (Table E.1) and a list of initiating events and circumstances (Table E.2) that can result in hazardous\nsituations, which can result in harm. Table E.3 provides examples in a logical progression of how a hazard\ncan be transformed into a hazardous situation and produce harm by a sequence of events or circumstances.\nRecognising how hazards progress to hazardous situations is critical for estimating the probability of\noccurrence and severity of harm that could result. An objective of the process is to compile a comprehensive\nset of hazardous situations. The identification of hazards and sequences of events are stepping stones to\nachieve this.

It can be self-contained or it can reference other documents\nto fulfil the requirements described in 3.4.\nThe makeup and level of detail for the plan should be commensurate with the level of risk associated with the\nmedical device. The requirements identified in 3.4 are the minimum requirements for a risk management plan.\nManufacturers can include other items such as time-schedule, risk analysis tools, or a rationale for the choice\nof specific risk acceptability criteria.\nF.2 Scope of the plan\nThe scope identifies and describes the medical device and the life-cycle phases for which each element of the\nplan is applicable.\nAll elements of the risk management process should be mapped to the manufacturer's defined product life-\ncycle. Some of the elements of the risk management process will occur during the phases of the\nmanufacturer's established product realization process (see for example ISO 13485:2003[8]), such as the\ndesign and development control. The remaining elements will occur during the other life-cycle phases through\nto product decommissioning. The risk management plan provides this mapping for a specific product either\nexplicitly or by reference to other documents.\nAlthough all the risk management activities need to be planned, a manufacturer can have several plans\ncovering different parts of the life-cycle. By making it clear what scope each plan has, it is possible to confirm\nthat the whole life-cycle is covered.\nF.3 Assignment of responsibilities and authorities\nThe risk management plan should identify the personnel with responsibility for the execution of specific risk\nmanagement activities, for example reviewer(s), expert(s), independent verification specialist(s), individual(s)\nwith approval authority (see 3.2). This assignment can be included in a resource allocation matrix defined for\nthe design project.\nF.4 Requirements for review of risk management activities\nThe risk management plan should detail how and when these management reviews will occur for a specific\nmedical device. The requirements for the review of risk management activities could be part of other quality\nsystem review requirements (see for example ISO 13485:2003[8], 7.3.4).\nCOPYRIGHT Danish Standards.

The criteria can be common for similar categories of medical device. Criteria for risk acceptability\ncan be part of the manufacturer\u2019s established quality management system, which can be referenced in the risk\nmanagement plan (see for example ISO 13485:2003[8], 7.1).\nF.6 Verification activities\nThe risk management plan will specify how the two distinct verification activities required by this International\nStandard will be carried out (see also A.2.6.3). Verifying the effectiveness of risk control measures can require\nthe collection of clinical data, usability studies, etc. (see also 2.28) The risk management plan can detail the\nverification activities explicitly or by reference to the plan for other verification activities.\nF.7 Method or methods of obtaining relevant post-production information\nThe method or methods of obtaining post-production information can be part of established quality\nmanagement system procedures (see for example ISO 13485:2003[8], 8.2). Manufacturers should establish\ngeneric procedures to collect information from various sources such as users, service personnel, training\npersonnel, incident reports and customer feedback. While a reference to the quality management system\nprocedures can suffice in most cases, any product-specific requirements should be directly added to the risk\nmanagement plan.\nThe risk management plan should include documentation of decisions, based on a risk analysis, about what\nsort of post-market surveillance is appropriate for the device, for example, whether reactive surveillance is\nadequate or whether proactive studies are needed. Details of clinical studies envisaged should be specified.\nCOPYRIGHT Danish Standards. NOT FOR COMMERCIAL USE OR REPRODUCTION.

The basic\nprinciple is that the chain of events is analysed step by step.\nPreliminary Hazard Analysis (PHA) is a technique that can be used early in the development process to\nidentify the hazards, hazardous situations, and events that can cause harm when few of the details of the\nmedial device design are known.\nFault Tree Analysis (FTA) is especially useful in safety engineering, early in the development stages, for the\nidentification and prioritization of hazards and hazardous situations as well as for analysing adverse events.\nFailure Mode and Effects Analysis (FMEA) and Failure Mode, Effects and Criticality Analysis (FMECA) are\ntechniques by which an effect or consequences of individual components are systematically identified and is\nmore appropriate as the design matures.\nHazard and Operability Study (HAZOP) and Hazard Analysis and Critical Control Point (HACCP) are typically\nused in the latter stages of the development phase to verify and then optimize design concepts or changes.\nG.2 Preliminary Hazard Analysis (PHA)\nPHA is an inductive method of analysis with the objective of identifying the hazards, hazardous situations and\nevents that can cause harm for a given activity, facility or system. It is most commonly carried out early in the\ndevelopment of a project when there is little information on design details or operating procedures and can\noften be a precursor to further studies. It can be useful when analysing existing systems or prioritizing hazards\nwhere circumstances prevent a more extensive technique from being used.\nIn a PHA, one formulates a list of hazards and generic hazardous situations by considering characteristics\nsuch as:\na)\nmaterials used or produced and their reactivity;\nb)\nequipment used;\nc)\noperating environment;\nd)\nlayout;\ne)\ninterfaces among system components.\nThe method is completed with the identification of the probabilities that the accident happens, the qualitative\nevaluation of the extent of possible injury or damage to health that could result, and the identification of\npossible remedial measures. The results obtained can be presented in different ways such as tables and trees.\nSee IEC 60300-3-9:1995[21], A.5, for more information on the procedures for PHA.\nCOPYRIGHT Danish Standards.

Following stepwise identification of undesirable system operation to successively lower system\nlevels will lead to the desired system level, which is usually either the component fault mode or the lowest\nlevel at which risk control measures can be applied. This will reveal the combinations most likely to lead to the\npostulated consequence. The results are represented pictorially in the form of a tree of fault modes. At each\nlevel in the tree, combinations of fault modes are described with logical operators (AND, OR, etc.). The fault\nmodes identified in the tree can be events that are associated with hardware faults, human errors, or any\nother pertinent event, which leads to the undesired event. They are not limited to the single-fault condition.\nFTA allows a systematic approach, which, at the same time, is sufficiently flexible to allow analysis of a variety\nof factors, including human interactions. FTA is used in risk analysis as a tool to provide an estimate of fault\nprobabilities and to identify single fault and common mode faults that result in hazardous situations. The\npictorial representation leads to an easy understanding of the system behaviour and the factors included, but,\nas the trees become large, processing of fault trees can require computer systems, which are readily available.\nSee IEC 61025[28] for more information on the procedures for FTA.\nG.4 Failure Mode and Effects Analysis (FMEA)\nFMEA is a technique by which the consequences of an individual fault mode are systematically identified and\nevaluated. It is an inductive technique using the question \u201cWhat happens if ... ?\u201d. Components are analysed\none at a time, thus generally looking at a single-fault condition. This is done in a \u201cbottom-up\u201d mode, i.e.,\nfollowing the procedure to the next higher functional system level.\nThe FMEA is not restricted to a failure of a component's design but can also include failures in the\nmanufacturing and assembling of components (Process FMEA) and the use or misuse of the product by the\nend user (Application FMEA). FMEA can be extended to incorporate an investigation of the individual\ncomponent fault modes, their probability of occurrence and detectability (only to the degree that detection will\nenable preventive measures in the context of this International Standard) and also the degree of severity of\nthe consequences. The FMEA can become a Failure Mode, Effects and Criticality Analysis (FMECA). In order\nto perform such an analysis, the construction of the medical device should be known in some detail.\nFMEA can also be a useful technique to deal with use error. Disadvantages of this technique can arise from\ndifficulties in dealing with redundancies and the incorporation of repair or preventive maintenance actions, as\nwell as its restriction on single-fault conditions.\nSee IEC 60812[27] for more information on the procedures for FMEA.\nG.5 Hazard and Operability Study (HAZOP)\nHAZOP is similar to an FMEA. HAZOP is based on a theory that assumes accidents are caused by deviations\nfrom the design or operating intentions. It is a systematic technique for identifying hazards and operability\nproblems. It was originally developed for use in the chemical process industry. While the use of HAZOP\nstudies in the chemical industry focuses on deviations from design intent, there are alternative applications for\na medical device developer. A HAZOP can be applied to the operation/function of the medical device (e.g., to\nthe existing methods/processes used for the diagnosis, treatment or alleviation of disease as the \u201cdesign\nintent\u201d), or to a process used in the manufacture or maintenance/service of the medical device\n(e.g., sterilization) that can have significant impact on the function of the medical device. Two particular\nfeatures of a HAZOP are as follows:\n\u007f it uses a team of people with expertise covering the design of the medical device and its application;\n\u007f guide words (NONE, PART OF, etc.) are used to help identify deviations from normal use.\nCOPYRIGHT Danish Standards.

It was originally\ndeveloped by NASA to prevent food poisoning of astronauts. It is based on a set of principles and defined\nterms. Applied to medical devices, HACCP is used for the control and monitoring of initiating causes of\nproduct hazards originating in processes, particularly manufacturing processes.\nThe core curriculum of HACCP consists of the following seven principles:\n1\nConduct hazard analysis (4.3) and identify\npreventive measures (6.2)\n2\nDetermine the critical control points (CCPs)\n(6.2)\n3\nEstablish critical limits (4.2 and Clause 5)\n4\nMonitor each CCP (6.3 and Clause 9)\n5\nEstablish corrective actions (Clause 9)\n6\nEstablish verification procedures (6.3 and\nClause 9)\n7\nEstablish record-keeping and documentation\nprocedures (3.5 and Clause 8)\n\nEach product has its own hazards that are related to its intended use. Hazardous situations could be initiated\nby events (causes or contributing factors) during different life-cycle stages, such as design, manufacturing,\nservice, use, disposal, etc. For examples of some types of hazard, see Annex E.\nThe heart of an effective HACCP system focuses on the continuing control and monitoring (HACCP\nprinciples 2, 3 and 4), of the identified hazards. A manufacturer demonstrates the effectiveness of\nestablished control measure(s), (HACCP principles 5 and 6), by establishing methodically documented\nprocess mapping, process hazard analysis and critical control plan, (HACCP principle 7).\nThe HACCP system uses the following tools as documented evidence for record keeping:\na)\nProcess flow diagram\nThe purpose of the diagram is to provide a clear and simple description of the steps involved in the process.\nThe diagram is necessary to the HACCP team in its subsequent work. The diagram can also serve as a future\nguide for others who need to understand the process for their verification activities. The scope of the flow\ndiagram should cover all the processing steps that are directly under the control of the manufacturer.\nb) Hazard analysis worksheet\nHazard analysis is the identification of hazards and of their initiating causes. The analysis records contain:\n1)\nthe identification and listing of steps in the process where hazards of significance occur;\n2)\nthe listing of all identified hazards and their significance associated with each step;\nCOPYRIGHT Danish Standards.

It focuses on the management of risk to patients from the use of IVD examination results.\nExamples used are intended to illustrate concepts and serve as a starting point for risk management of IVD\nmedical devices. They are not meant to be exhaustive. For definitions of terms used in this annex,\nsee ISO 18113-1 [42].\nIVD medical devices are intended for use in the collection, preparation and examination of samples taken from\nthe human body. These devices include reagents, instruments, software, sample collection devices and\nreceptacles, calibrators, control materials and related accessories. These devices can be used alone or in\ncombination as a system.\nResults provided by IVD medical devices can be used in the diagnosis of disease or other conditions,\nincluding determination of the state of health, in order to cure, mitigate, treat or prevent disease, as well as\nmonitoring of therapeutic drugs and determining the safety of donated blood or organs. These devices can be\nused by persons with various levels of education, training and experience and in different settings with various\ndegrees of environmental control. For example, some IVD medical devices are intended for use by\nprofessional analysts in medical laboratories, others by healthcare providers at the point-of-care, and still\nothers by lay users at home.\nAt one end of the spectrum, IVD examinations performed in a laboratory are reported to a physician, who\ninterprets the data and diagnoses, treats or monitors a patient; at the other end, IVD examinations are\nperformed by the patient, who uses the results to monitor and medicate his/her condition.\nBecause of the diversity of IVD medical devices and their intended uses, these guidelines might not be\napplicable in all cases. For IVD medical devices for self-testing, the terms \u201cpatient\u201d and \u201clay user\u201d will be used\ninterchangeably, even though these can be different individuals (e.g. a parent can perform glucose\nmeasurements on a diabetic child). Where the term \u201cphysician\u201d is used, it should be recognised that other\nhealthcare providers can also order, receive, interpret and act on IVD examination results.\nIVD medical devices have the potential to contribute to patient harm. Incorrect or delayed results can lead to\ninappropriate or delayed medical decisions and actions that result in harm to patients. Incorrect results from\nIVD medical devices intended for transfusion or transplantation screening have the potential to cause harm to\nblood or organ recipients, and incorrect results from IVD medical devices intended for detecting infectious\ndiseases have the potential to be a hazard to public health.\nOne risk model for IVD medical devices used in a laboratory is illustrated in Figure H.1. In this example, a\nfailure of the manufacturer\u2019s quality system (e.g. during design, development, manufacturing, packaging,\nlabelling, distribution or servicing) initiates a sequence of events, beginning with a defective or malfunctioning\nIVD medical device. When the device fails in the medical laboratory, an incorrect examination result is\nproduced. If the result is not identified as incorrect by the laboratory, it will be reported to the healthcare\nprovider.

In some cases, the IVD result can be the primary or even the only\nbasis for a medical decision. The probability of a patient being harmed is a combination of the probabilities\nthat each event illustrated in Figure H.1 would occur. Each individual probability of occurrence is partially\noffset by a probability that the hazard or hazardous situation will be detected by the manufacturer, the\nlaboratory or the physician, thus allowing intervention and avoiding harm. The actual sequence of events will\ndepend on the particular IVD medical device and its application.\nFigure H.1 also shows that the laboratory can contribute to incorrect or delayed examination results, for\nexample as a consequence of failing to follow procedures, adhere to maintenance or calibration schedules, or\nheed warnings or precautions. In addition, events leading to patient harm can also be initiated in the\nlaboratory. The need for reduction of errors through risk management in the medical laboratory has been\nrecognised, and information for safety as an output of the manufacturer\u2019s risk management process could\nserve as an input to the laboratory\u2019s risk management process.\nH.2 Risk analysis\nH.2.1 Identification of intended uses\nH.2.1.1\nGeneral\nIVD medical devices for laboratory or point of care examinations have two users: (1) an operator who\nperforms the examination, and (2) a healthcare provider who receives, interprets and acts on the results. In\nthe case of IVD medical devices for self-testing, the patient could be the only user.\nIdentification of intended uses should consider the objective intent of the manufacturer with respect to both\nelements of use: (1) use of the IVD medical device to produce an examination result, and (2) use of the\nexamination result to reach a decision on the diagnosis, treatment or monitoring of a patient.\nCOPYRIGHT Danish Standards.

Not every E-hCG examination procedure has performance\ncharacteristics suitable for all three types of sample matrix.\nH.2.1.3\nIndications for use\nThe indications for use include the medical applications and patient populations for which the IVD medical\ndevice is intended.\nFor example, E-hCG results can be used for detecting pregnancy, for screening pregnant women for foetal\nDown's syndrome, and for monitoring certain cancers. Each medical application may have different\nrequirements for measurement sensitivity, specificity, precision and trueness.\nH.2.2 Identification of possible use errors\nH.2.2.1\nUse errors\nUse errors include actions not intended by the manufacturer, such as procedure shortcuts, optimization\nattempts and improvization, as well as omissions of actions intended by the manufacturer, such as\nthose prescribed in the instructions for use.\nH.2.2.2\nExamples of possible use errors by laboratory personnel\nThe following are examples of possible use errors in the laboratory.

Failure to meet the performance characteristics required for a specific medical use could\nresult in a hazardous situation that should be evaluated for risk to patients.\nH.2.3.2\nPerformance characteristics of quantitative examination procedures\nQuantitative examination procedures are intended to determine the amount or concentration of an analyte.\nResults are reported on an interval scale. The main analytical performance characteristics of quantitative\nexamination procedures are precision (imprecision), trueness (bias), analytical specificity and quantitation limit.\nPerformance requirements depend on the medical application. A falsely high or falsely low result can lead to\nan incorrect diagnosis or delayed treatment, and the consequent harm to the patient could depend on the\nconcentration of analyte and magnitude of bias.\nH.2.3.3\nPerformance characteristics of qualitative examination procedures\nQualitative examination procedures are only intended to detect the presence or absence of an analyte.\nResults are reported as positive, negative or inconclusive. Performance of qualitative examination procedures\nis generally expressed in terms of diagnostic sensitivity and specificity. A positive result when the analyte is\nabsent or a negative result when the analyte is present can lead to incorrect diagnosis or delayed treatment\nand to harm to the patient.\nCOPYRIGHT Danish Standards.

Failure to produce a\nresult when it is needed could result in a hazardous situation.\nH.2.3.5\nAncillary patient information\nIn some cases, examination results can require demographic information about the patient, as well as\npertinent information about the sample or its examination for proper interpretation. Patient identification,\nsample identification, sample type, sample description, measurement units, reference intervals, age, gender,\nand genetic factors are examples of such information, which might be entered manually by a laboratory\nanalyst or automatically by a laboratory computer system. If an IVD medical device is designed to report\nancillary information with the examination result, failure to associate the correct information with the\nexamination result could affect the proper interpretation of the result and lead to a hazardous situation.\nH.2.4 Identification of known and foreseeable hazards\nH.2.4.1\nHazards to the patient\nFrom the standpoint of a patient, an IVD examination result is a hazard if it might lead to (1) inappropriate\nmedical action that could result in injury or death, or (2) failure to take appropriate medical action that could\nprevent injury or death. An incorrect or delayed IVD examination result can be caused by an IVD medical\ndevice malfunction, which is the initiating hazard in a foreseeable sequence of events leading to a hazardous\nsituation. The identification of hazards and sequences of events are intended to help the manufacturer\ncompile a comprehensive list of hazardous situations. The manufacturer determines what is considered a\nhazard during the risk analysis.\nAs illustrated in Figure H.1, a hazardous situation can occur if a healthcare provider receives an incorrect\nresult and acts upon it. A hazardous situation can also occur if a result is not available when it is needed. In\nthe case of devices for self-testing, a hazardous situation can occur when an incorrect result is obtained by a\npatient, or a result is not available when it is needed.\nFor quantitative examination procedures, a result can be considered incorrect if the difference from a correct\nvalue exceeds a limit based on clinical utility. The clinical significance of an incorrect result can depend on the\nmagnitude of the difference between the measured value and a correct value, as well as the physiological\nstatus of the patient (e.g., hypoglycaemic or hyperglycaemic).\nFor qualitative examination procedures, in which only a positive or negative result is provided, (e.g., HIV and\npregnancy examinations), results are either correct or incorrect.\nThe following hazards could cause or contribute to misdiagnosis with the potential for harmful medical\nintervention or delays:\n\u007f incorrect results (see H.2.3.2 and H.2.3.3);\n\u007f delayed results (see H.2.3.4);\n\u007f incorrect information accompanying the result (see H.2.3.5).\nH.2.4.2\nRelationship to performance characteristics\nFailure to meet specifications for any of the performance characteristics related to safety (see H.2.3) should\nbe evaluated in order to determine if a hazardous situation could result.\nTools for analysing such hazards, such as Preliminary Hazard Analysis (PHA), Fault Tree Analysis (FTA),\nFailure Mode and Effects Analysis (FMEA), and Hazard Analysis and Critical Control Points (HACCP), are\ndescribed in Annex G.\nCOPYRIGHT Danish Standards.

This could be due to the uncertainty of examination results, the\nbiological variability of patient samples, choice of a cut-off value or other factors. An incorrect result in normal\nuse could lead to a hazardous situation for an individual patient; e.g.,\n\u007f imperfect discrimination between positive and negative samples: qualitative examination procedures\ntypically exhibit inherent false negative and false positive rates, caused in part by uncertainties associated\nwith determination of a suitable cut-off value;\n\u007f uncertainty of measurement: state-of-the-art technology can limit the precision of quantitative IVD medical\ndevices, such as glucose monitoring systems described in ISO 15197[13]; if performance criteria only\nrequire 95 % of the results to meet a specified limit based on medical utility, then up to 5 % of the\nindividual results are allowed to fall outside the limit;\nCOPYRIGHT Danish Standards.

The intended uses and possible misuses discussed in H.2.1 and H.2.2 should be considered.\nEstimating the severity of harm requires an understanding of the medical use of the IVD examination results,\nthe analytical performance requirements for each application and the extent to which medical decisions are\nbased on IVD examination results. For this reason, qualified medical input to the risk estimation process is\nessential.\nH.2.5.3\nEstimating probability of occurrence\nAs illustrated in Annex E, the probability that use of an IVD medical device will result in harm depends on the\ncumulative probabilities associated with a series of events.\nCOPYRIGHT Danish Standards.

While more subjective than Parkes\u2019 survey approach, an interview strategy can be\nconstructed to help elicit degrees of bias or imprecision that might place patients at risk.\nH.3 Risk evaluation\nThe depth of a risk evaluation should be proportional to the severity of the potential harm. The risk of each\nincorrect result identified as hazardous should be evaluated as described in D.3 and D.4.\nH.4 Risk control\nH.4.1 General\nSeverity of harm to the patient is determined by the medical intervention, or lack of intervention, triggered by\nthe IVD examination result. The ability of a manufacturer to affect the severity of harm depends on the\nparticular IVD examination.\nIf the medical intervention depends on the magnitude of the reported value, such as from examinations for the\nconcentration of glucose, electrolytes, therapeutic drugs and certain enzymes, the severity of harm might be\nreduced by risk control measures aimed at limiting the degree of bias, imprecision or interference. If the result\nis either positive or negative however, the severity of harm to the patient cannot be reduced by the\nmanufacturer.\nRisks to the patient from incorrect IVD examination results are generally reduced by lowering the probability of\noccurrence. Activities to reduce risks from incorrect results should be prioritized according to the hierarchy in\n6.2.

Hazard Analysis and Critical\nControl Points (HACCP, see G.6) can help identify steps in the manufacturing process to prevent\nnonconforming product, such as:\n\u007f reagents with excessive lot-to-lot variability;\n\u007f instrument components that cause spurious results;\n\u007f calibrator values that exceed bias specifications;\n\u007f control materials, calibrators or reagents that fail to meet shelf-life claims.\nH.4.2.2\nProtective measures\nIf improving the design of the IVD medical device is not practicable, then perhaps additional controls can be\nincorporated into the device to detect conditions that produce incorrect results; e.g.,\n\u007f sample integrity checks to detect unacceptable samples (e.g., hemolysed);\n\u007f removal of foam (if the sampling device has a liquid level sensor) or fibrin clots from the sample;\n\u007f on-board sensors and software checks to detect adverse system conditions (e.g., incorrect temperature,\nspectrophotometer drift, plugged pipetting mechanism);\n\u007f built-in controls to detect calibrator, reagent or instrument failures;\n\u007f alarms, error messages or algorithms that suppress incorrect results;\n\u007f plausibility algorithms to identify improbable results.\nCOPYRIGHT Danish Standards.

This information is supplied by the\nmanufacturer. Reliable estimates of performance characteristics at recognised medical decision points\ndisclose residual risks and enable the proper interpretation of examination results; e.g.,\n\u007f analytical specificity (e.g., effects of interfering or cross-reacting substances);\n\u007f trueness (i.e., acceptable bias);\n\u007f precision;\n\u007f detection limit or quantitation limit;\n\u007f accuracy (combination of precision and trueness);\n\u007f diagnostic sensitivity (fraction of true positive results in patients with disease);\n\u007f diagnostic specificity (fraction of true negative results in patients without disease).\nH.4.2.3.2\nInformation to prevent production of incorrect results\nInstructions for use, procedural limitations and environmental specifications are necessary to help users\nprevent incorrect (hazardous) results; e.g.,\n\u007f sample collection, storage and preparation requirements;\n\u007f known interfering substances;\n\u007f validated measuring interval;\n\u007f warnings about improper use that can contribute to incorrect results;\n\u007f limitations regarding specific patient populations;\n\u007f warnings about inappropriate clinical conditions or inappropriate sample types;\n\u007f proper cleaning methods;\n\u007f preventive maintenance procedures and maintenance intervals;\n\u007f reagent storage requirements and expiration date.\nCOPYRIGHT Danish Standards.

If\nthe instructions for use are silent with respect to urine samples, some laboratories may use the device to\nexamine urine samples, particularly if state-of-the-art IVD medical devices are capable of examining urine\nsamples. Without an indication that the procedure will not perform satisfactorily with urine samples,\nexamination of such samples would be a foreseeable use error.\nSimilarly, examination results can be used for medical applications that were not intended by the manufacturer\nand might not be appropriate for that IVD medical device. The manufacturer should evaluate the risks from\nsuch applications, taking into consideration factors such as experience with similar devices, similar\ncircumstances of use for other devices, and the likelihood of such use. A manufacturer might need to provide\nusers with appropriate warnings, precautions and limitations to reduce the risks.\nH.4.2.6\nIVD medical device standards\nInternational standards, national standards, regulations and regulatory guidance documents are available for\nsome types of IVD medical devices. Adherence to recognised product standards, regulatory requirements and\nguidelines that address inherent safety, protective measures and information for safety could be used to\ndefine requirements for design and testing, and conformance can be cited as evidence of risk control; for\nexample, ISO 15197[13], ISO 17593[16], ISO 19001[18] and ISO 18113-1 [42].\nH.4.3 Verifying risk control effectiveness\nThe implementation and effectiveness of risk control measures \u2013 including information for safety \u2013 require\nverification. The degree of verification depends on the risk being controlled.\nFor risks where the severity or the probability of occurrence of harm is low, a review of complaint files can be\nsufficient verification. Where appropriate, this verification should include a prospective review of available\ninformation for IVD medical devices with similar risk controls. For risks where the severity or the probability of\noccurrence of harm is high, a prospective study might be needed to verify the effectiveness of the risk controls.\nFor example, a human factors study can assess the extent of user comprehension and compliance with\nwarnings and instructions and verify the effectiveness of the information supplied for safety. This can include\nhuman factors such as print size, reading level, properly highlighted warning information, etc.\nAssumptions about the effectiveness of information for safety should be made with caution. The following\nlimitations should be considered when estimating the reduction in risk resulting from specific information\nsupplied by the manufacturer.\n\u007f Laboratory accreditation requirements, regulations and enforcement are not uniform throughout the world;\nquality control and quality assurance practices vary widely.\n\u007f Instructions for use provided with professional use IVD medical devices are intended for medical\nlaboratories; information about contra-indicated uses, interfering drugs, and other information pertaining\nto the use of IVD examination results might not reach the physicians who order the examinations.\nCOPYRIGHT Danish Standards.

The range\nof effects of potential biological hazards is wide and can include short-term effects such as acute toxicity,\nirritation to the skin, eye and mucosal surfaces, hemolysis and thrombogenicity, as well as long-term or\nspecific toxic effects such as subchronic and chronic toxic effects, sensitization, genotoxicity, carcinogenicity\n(tumorigenicity) and effects on reproduction including teratogenicity.\nISO 10993-1[5] sets out the general principles for the biological evaluation of materials/medical devices.\nI.2 Estimation of biological risks\nI.2.1 Factors to be taken into account\nThe biological risk analysis should take account of:\n\u007f the physical and chemical characteristics of the various choices of materials;\n\u007f any history of clinical use or human exposure data;\n\u007f any existing toxicology and other biological safety data on product and component materials;\n\u007f test procedures.\nThe amount of data required and the depth of the investigation will vary with the intended use and are\ndependent upon the nature and duration of patient contact. Data requirements are usually less stringent for\npackaging materials, medical devices contacting intact skin, and any component of a medical device that does\nnot come into direct contact with body tissues, infusible liquids, mucous membranes or compromised skin.\nCurrent knowledge of the material/medical device provided by scientific literature, previous clinical experience,\nand other relevant data should be reviewed to establish any need for additional data. In some cases, it can\nbecome necessary to obtain formulation data, residue data (e.g. from sterilization processes, monomers),\nbiological test data, etc.\nI.2.2 Chemical nature of the materials\nInformation characterizing the chemical identity and biological response of materials is useful in assessing a\nmedical device for its intended use. Some factors that can affect the biocompatibility of the material include:\n\u007f the identity, concentration, availability and toxicity of all constituents (e.g. additives, processing aids,\nmonomers, catalysts, reaction products);\n\u007f the influence of biodegradation and corrosion on the material.\nWhere reactive or hazardous ingredients have been used in, or can be formed by, the production, processing,\nstorage or degradation of a material, the possibility of exposure to residues should be considered.

This can take the form of experimental data or\ninformation on the chemistry of the materials involved.\nWhere the necessary data (e.g. complete formulation data) are not available to a manufacturer because of\nconfidentiality, verification should be obtained that an assessment has been carried out, of the suitability of the\nmaterial for use in the proposed application.\nI.2.3 Prior use\nAvailable information on previous uses of each material or intended additive and on any adverse reactions\nencountered should be reviewed. However, the previous use of an ingredient or material does not necessarily\nassure its suitability in similar applications. Account should be taken of the intended use, the concentration of\nthe ingredients, and current toxicological information.\nI.2.4 Biological safety test data\nISO 10993-1[5] gives guidance on which tests in the ISO 10993 series should be considered for a particular\napplication.

Information for safety gives instructions on action(s) to take or not to take to\navoid a risk.\nDisclosure of individual and overall residual risk(s) gives background and relevant information necessary to\nexplain the residual risk so users can proactively take appropriate actions to minimize exposure to the residual\nrisk(s).\nIt should be recognised that both the structure and contents of the information as well as the implementation\nmethods might need to be taken into consideration.\nIt should be recognised that information for safety, in particular, might need to be communicated in different\nways, depending on when in the medical device life-cycle the information is to be communicated, e.g. as\ncautionary statements in the accompanying documents or in an advisory notice, or via the user interface of a\nmenu driven device.\nJ.2 Information for safety\nWhen developing information for safety it is important to identify to whom this information is to be provided\nand how it is to be provided. The manufacturer should provide an explanation of the risk, the consequences of\nexposure and what should be done or avoided to prevent harm.\nIn developing the information, the manufacturer should consider:\n\u007f the level of priority appropriate to classify an action (danger, warning, caution, note, etc.);\n\u007f the level or detail of information needed;\n\u007f the location for the information for safety (e.g. a warning label);\n\u007f the wording or pictures to be used to ensure clarity and understandability;\n\u007f the immediate recipients (e.g. users, service personnel, installers, patients);\n\u007f the appropriate media for providing the information, (e.g. instructions for use, labels, alarms, warnings in\nthe user interface);\n\u007f regulatory requirements, etc.\nCOPYRIGHT Danish Standards.

Discretion as to the risk control options/measures:\n\na) 6.2 of ISO 14971 obliges the manufacturer to \"use one or more of the following risk control options\nin the priority order listed: (a) inherent safety by design; (b) protective measures in the medical device\nitself or in the manufacturing process; (c) information for safety\" and leaves a discretion as to the\napplication of these three options: shall the second or third control option still be used when the first\nwas used? 6.4 indicates that further risk control measures do not need to be taken if, after applying\none of the control options, the risk is judged acceptable according to the criteria of the risk\nmanagement plan.\nb) However, the second sentence of Section A.2 of Annex I to Directive 98/79/EC requests \"to\nconform to safety principles, taking account of the generally acknowledged state of the art\" and \"to\nselect the most appropriate solutions\" by applying cumulatively what has been called \"control options\"\nor \"control mechanisms\" in the standard.\nc) Accordingly, the manufacturer must apply all the \"control options\" and may not stop his endeavours\nif the first or the second control option has reduced the risk to an \"acceptable level\" (unless the\nadditional control option(s) do(es) not improve the safety).\n\n6. Deviation as to the first risk control option:\n\na) 6.2 of ISO 14971 obliges the manufacturer to \"use one or more of the following risk control options\nin the priority order listed: (a) inherent safety by design \u2026\" without determining what is meant by this\nterm.\nb) However, the first indent of the second sentence of Section A.2 of Annex I to Directive 98/79/EC\nrequires to \"eliminate or reduce risks as far as possible (inherently safe design and construction)\".\nc) Accordingly, as the Directive is more precise than the standard, manufacturers must apply the\nformer and cannot rely purely on the application of the standard.\n\n7. Information of the users influencing the residual risk:\n\na) The residual risk is in 2.15 and in 6.4 of ISO 14971 defined as the risk remaining after application of\nthe risk control measures. 6.2 of ISO 14971 regards \"information for safety\" to be a control option.\nb) However, the last indent of Section A.2 of Annex I to Directive 98/79/EC says that users shall be\ninformed about the residual risks. This indicates that, according to Annex I to Directive 98/79/EC and\ncontrary to the concept of the standard, the information given to the users does not reduce the\n(residual) risk any further.\nc) Accordingly, manufacturers shall not attribute any additional risk reduction to the information given\nto the users.\n\n\nConformity assessment procedures\n\nEN ISO 14971 can also be used to support the following parts of conformity assessment procedures in\nthe European Medical Devices Directives:\n\n\u2212\nan adequate description of results of the risk analysis (included in the risk management file, see\n3.5 of EN ISO 14971:2012);\n\n\u2212\nan undertaking by the manufacturer to institute and keep up to date a systematic procedure to\nreview experience gained from devices in the post-production phase and to implement appropriate\nmeans to apply any necessary corrective action (see Clause 9 of EN ISO 14971:2012).\n\nNOTE\nOther and more detailed requirements are applicable to this aspect.\n\n\n\nWARNING \u2014 Other requirements and other EU Directives may be applicable to a product\nfalling within the scope of this standard.\n\u0003\n\nCOPYRIGHT Danish Standards.

The work of preparing International Standards is normally carried out through ISO\ntechnical committees. Each member body interested in a subject for which a technical committee has been\nestablished has the right to be represented on that committee. International organizations, governmental and\nnon-governmental, in liaison with ISO, also take part in the work. ISO collaborates closely with the\nInternational Electrotechnical Commission (IEC) on all matters of electrotechnical standardization.\nInternational Standards are drafted in accordance with the rules given in the ISO/IEC Directives, Part 2.\nThe main task of technical committees is to prepare International Standards. Draft International Standards\nadopted by the technical committees are circulated to the member bodies for voting. Publication as an\nInternational Standard requires approval by at least 75 % of the member bodies casting a vote.\nAttention is drawn to the possibility that some of the elements of this document may be the subject of patent\nrights. ISO shall not be held responsible for identifying any or all such patent rights.\nInternational Standard ISO 14971 was prepared by ISO/TC 210, Quality management and corresponding\ngeneral aspects for medical devices, and Subcommittee IEC/SC 62A, Common aspects of electrical\nequipment used in medical practice. Annex H, \u201cGuidance on risk management for in vitro diagnostic medical\ndevices\u201d, was prepared by ISO/TC 212, Clinical laboratory testing and in vitro diagnostic test systems.\nThis second edition cancels and replaces the first edition (ISO 14971:2000) as well as the amendment\nISO 14971:2000/Amd.1:2003.\nFor purposes of future IEC maintenance, Subcommittee 62A has decided that the contents of this publication will\nremain unchanged until the maintenance result date1) indicated on the IEC web site under http://webstore.iec.ch\nin the data related to the specific publication. At this date, the publication will be\n\u007f reconfirmed,\n\u007f withdrawn,\n\u007f replaced by a revised edition or\n\u007f amended.\nThis corrected version of ISO 14971:2007 incorporates the following correction:\n\u007f a corrected version of Figure 1 on page 6.\n\n1) IEC National Committees are requested to note that for this publication the maintenance result date is 2014.\nCOPYRIGHT Danish Standards.

For other manufacturers, e.g., in other healthcare industries, this\nInternational Standard could be used as informative guidance in developing and maintaining a risk\nmanagement system and process.\nThis International Standard deals with processes for managing risks, primarily to the patient, but also to the\noperator, other persons, other equipment and the environment.\nAs a general concept, activities in which an individual, organization or government is involved can expose\nthose or other stakeholders to hazards which can cause loss of or damage to something they value. Risk\nmanagement is a complex subject because each stakeholder places a different value on the probability of\nharm occurring and its severity.\nIt is accepted that the concept of risk has two components:\na)\nthe probability of occurrence of harm;\nb)\nthe consequences of that harm, that is, how severe it might be.\nThe concepts of risk management are particularly important in relation to medical devices because of the\nvariety of stakeholders including medical practitioners, the organizations providing health care, governments,\nindustry, patients and members of the public.\nAll stakeholders need to understand that the use of a medical device entails some degree of risk. The\nacceptability of a risk to a stakeholder is influenced by the components listed above and by the stakeholder\u2019s\nperception of the risk. Each stakeholder\u2019s perception of the risk can vary greatly depending upon their cultural\nbackground, the socio-economic and educational background of the society concerned, the actual and\nperceived state of health of the patient, and many other factors. The way a risk is perceived also takes into\naccount, for example, whether exposure to the hazard seems to be involuntary, avoidable, from a man-made\nsource, due to negligence, arising from a poorly understood cause, or directed at a vulnerable group within\nsociety. The decision to use a medical device in the context of a particular clinical procedure requires the\nresidual risks to be balanced against the anticipated benefits of the procedure. Such judgments should take\ninto account the intended use, performance and risks associated with the medical device, as well as the risks\nand benefits associated with the clinical procedure or the circumstances of use. Some of these judgments can\nbe made only by a qualified medical practitioner with knowledge of the state of health of an individual patient\nor the patient\u2019s own opinion.\nAs one of the stakeholders, the manufacturer makes judgments relating to safety of a medical device,\nincluding the acceptability of risks, taking into account the generally accepted state of the art, in order to\ndetermine the suitability of a medical device to be placed on the market for its intended use. This International\nStandard specifies a process through which the manufacturer of a medical device can identify hazards\nassociated with a medical device, estimate and evaluate the risks associated with these hazards, control\nthese risks, and monitor the effectiveness of that control.\nFor any particular medical device, other International Standards could require the application of specific\nmethods for managing risk.\n\nCOPYRIGHT Danish Standards.
