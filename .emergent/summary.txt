The AI engineer's work began by showcasing the Kalibr SDK's benefits for multi-model AI, which pivoted to building a robust QSP Compliance Checker using new architectural files. Initial development focused on constructing the  and fixing syntax errors. The agent then addressed core system dependencies, migrating from a potential PostgreSQL setup to MongoDB, integrating an Emergent LLM Key via , and setting up foundational modules (utils, AI, database). After successfully establishing a healthy, functional backend with working MongoDB and LLM services, and completing backend and frontend automated testing, the user requested a cleaned-up repository. The subsequent task involved creating a new  structure, migrating code, and integrating a full RAG solution with ChromaDB and . The current state involves debugging dependency conflicts during the RAG component import in the newly cleaned repository.

The goal is to develop an Enterprise QSP Compliance Checker for a medical device company. This system will validate internal Quality System Procedure (QSP) documents (supporting  and plain text) against regulatory standard change summaries, primarily ISO 13485:2024. The core problem is to alert companies if and where their internal documents need updating due to new regulatory changes, resulting in alerts like ISO change detected that impacts QSP doc X in section X.

Key features include:
- Manual uploads of internal QSP documents and regulatory change summaries (from sources like G Drive).
- AI-powered (A for AI) clause mapping with confidence scores.
- Compliance analysis to identify gaps and impacted sections.
- A user-friendly UI/dashboard.
- The alert system encompasses all analysis and mapping functionalities.
- The system must incorporate Retrieval Augmented Generation (RAG) with a vector database (ChromaDB) and semantic chunking to accurately read and map large amounts of data and regulatory summaries, ensuring accurate and reliable results despite context window limitations. Full integration of Kalibr SDK for multi-model AI is deferred.

<key_technical_concepts>
-   **Full-stack Development**: React (frontend), FastAPI (backend), MongoDB (database).
-   **AI/LLM Integration**: Multi-model support via , Emergent LLM Key, AI-powered clause mapping.
-   **RAG (Retrieval Augmented Generation)**: ChromaDB (vector store), sentence-transformers (embeddings), semantic chunking.
-   **Compliance Logic**: ISO 13485:2024, QSP document parsing, gap analysis.
-   **Infrastructure**: Kubernetes, Supervisor, Docker Compose, environment variable management.

The codebase initially centered around  and a new  for the robust build. The latter was then largely migrated and refined into a completely new, clean repository at  following user request, explicitly including RAG components.
</code_architecture>

<pending_tasks>
- Resolve  and  dependency compatibility issues to enable successful RAG component imports.
- Debug and thoroughly test the RAG implementation for accuracy and reliability, especially semantic search and compliance gap identification.
- Ensure the entire  repository is fully functional, stable, and production-ready as intended after RAG integration.

<current_work>
Immediately prior to this summary, the AI engineer completed a significant refactoring and cleanup, creating a new, focused repository at . This new repository aims to house the RAG-enabled Enterprise QSP Compliance System, eliminating non-essential files. The user explicitly requested to test and debug this code. The AI engineer initiated basic system tests, successfully verifying config and MongoDB imports. However, the current work is stalled on debugging RAG component imports, specifically encountering an  related to  and  compatibility, which prevents further testing of the RAG functionality.
